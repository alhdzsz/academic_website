abstract: What makes sovereign borrowers honor their debts to private foreign creditors? Why do private markets continue to lend to borrowers that have burned them in the past? The literature in economics suggests that there is a reputation mechanism in play, borrowers service their credit obligations because not doing so would limit their access to funds in the future. Though it is recognized that defaults occur and that domestic and international factors may play a role in these decisions, these potential influences have rarely been analyzed systematically and debtors tend to be characterized as a homogeneous and static group. 


  During financial crises, countries that cannot issue hard currencies are highly dependent on outside creditors as without continued funding their economies would collapse. During good times, rhetorical instruments either in support or defiance of global markets can be deployed by governments to serve a political agenda. However, this rarely translates into action, particularly so in the realm of finance. Countries usually service their commitments if they can and shy away from rattling markets without necessity. Why they stray from this well-trodden path in the few instances when they do is an issue this work would like to address. 


  This thesis explores two atypical cases. The first is that of Mexico which, under Vicente Fox in 2002, spearheaded efforts to disseminate the use of Collective Action Clauses (CACs) in emerging market sovereign bonds; reducing the momentum of a proposal for the creation of a formal mechanism to restructure sovereign debt. The second is Ecuador, which defaulted on its obligations to private creditors in 2008 and justified it by questioning the legitimacy of that debt rather than claiming an incapacity to pay. In both cases, bold moves regarding global private credit markets were taken without discernible economic or external pressure to do so. I argue that, in the rare instances in which domestic and international politics allow countries that are traditionally rule-takers to break that role, the way in which global financial markets are framed -- as promise or peril -- shapes their policies towards sovereign borrowing and restructuring.
