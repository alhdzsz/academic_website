abstract: The  objective  of  the  article  is  to  analyze  transparency  in  the  provision  of  nursing  home  services  towards  beneficiaries.  To  do  this,  we  identify  three  policy  dimensions  and  their  specific  elements,  what  allow  us  to  assess  transparency  in  the  implementation  of  these  services.  The  article  develops  and  empirically  tests  an  analytical  framework  to  assess  the  transparency of elderly care services in Spain. On the one hand, we examine the extent to which nursing home service providers (both public and private) are obliged to supply information  about  their  performance.  We  analyze  the  formal  obligations  for  both  public  and  private facilities in the seventeen autonomous communities (ACs). On the other hand, we examine the content of the messages posted on Twitter by the three biggest business associ-ations  of  the  sector  in  Spain,  namely,  Business  Federation  of  Assistance  for  Dependents  (Federación Empresarial de la Dependencia), Association of Dependency Services Compa-nies  (Asociación  de  Empresas  de  Servicios  para  la  Dependencia),  and  Business  Circle  of  Caring for People (Círculo Empresarial de Atención a las Personas), in order to determine whether transparency is a concern for the industry regardless of the regulatory requirements faced by direct service providers.
