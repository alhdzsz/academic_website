summary: We develop a composite Water Integrity Risk Index (WIRI) to identify and assess integrity risks in the urban W&S sector in selected settlements around the world.
title: Water and Sanitation Sector Integrity Risk Index
---

We employ a data-driven approach to develop a composite Water Integrity Risk Index (WIRI) made up of a host of objective proxy indicators as well as survey-based measures of corruption experience to identify and assess integrity risks in the urban W&S sector in selected settlements around the world. Unlike broaderscope corruption indices, the WIRI outlined in this paper uses administrative datasets and survey data capturing information on corruptible transactions; thus, our analysis is micro-level, narrowly focuses on the W&S sector and is both transparent and replicable. The result is an actionable index which measures integrity risks over 7 countries between 2012 and 2019.
