George,Nov 21 2021,"Qatar’s foreign minister recently called the Taliban’s actions to deny girls’ education in Afghanistan “very disappointing.” Applauding his country’s own progress on women’s rights, he added,“ [We] have also been trying to demonstrate for the Taliban how Muslim countries can conduct their laws, how they can deal with the women’s issues.” The Gulf has never been seen as a bastion for women’s rights. And yet, these comments prompted by the turmoil in Afghanistan are perhaps unsurprising. They illuminate subtle changes taking place in the region which could offer a unique lens into an understanding of women’s rights challenges in Afghanistan, the Arab world and beyond.For the Gulf states, there is a delicate balance between the region’s evolving geostrategic interests and a desire to appear as leaders of Muslim modernity. The crisis in Afghanistan and its implications for women only highlights these tensions further.The Gulf region has also long played a complicated role in Afghanistan’s trajectory. In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, along with Pakistan, were the only countries to officially recognize Taliban rule. Since then, the Gulf states have positioned themselves variously playing critical roles with respect to Afghanistan.Qatar hosted talks between Washington and the Taliban, and provided critical assistance to refugees in transit, while the UAE provided troops to support the US in its withdrawal, and Gulf states have served as a landing space and host for recent swaths of refugees, to some controversy. As the violence in Kabul escalated this summer, prominent Muslim clerics from Saudi Arabia and elsewhere met in Mecca, condemning Taliban violence as “unjustified,” the Secretary of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation even accusing the Taliban of perpetrating “genocide against Muslims.”Despite an unwavering commitment among the Gulf States to enshrining strict interpretations of religious conservatism and pursuing claims of cultural distinctiveness, perhaps nowhere is a quiet evolution in the Gulf more visible than on the issue of women. The Taliban takeover, though not directly linked to the Gulf’s own policies on women, is bringing this to the fore in a timely way.The rhetoric of gender equality is gaining traction in the Arab Gulf, where reforms over the last decade alongside the delayed ratification of the CEDAW convention in the 1990s and 2000s have begun to crack otherwise persisting rigid legal and social systems which not long ago allowed for little movement on gender equality. While still falling to the bottom of the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index, the region has seen swift gains in maternal mortality, education, with rates improving across Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, today mirroring many OECD countries. Saudi Arabia recently lifted restrictions allowing women to obtain passports and travel without permission from a male guardian, and enshrined new standards against gender discrimination and harassment in the workplace. My research on local press reporting in Kuwait found a swift expansion of the coverage using the language of gender discrimination in Kuwaiti media in the past five years, a topic around which the local press was previously relatively silent, and the country recently established a new domestic violence law. And the UAE now boasts a world-leading rate of 50% female representation in its Federal Nationalshiny reforms and sometimes surprisingly progressive rhetoric from the country’s overwhelmingly male political elite, the region remains a hotbed for violations on human rights and women’s rights. Kuwait’s new law on domestic violence was the result of hard-won gains prompted by a thriving women’s movement, which has long been calling to ‘Abolish 153’ by repealing the penal code which provides lesser sentences to male perpetrators of violence in circumstances of male ‘honor killing’. In spite of years of attention and advocacy, the code remains unreformed. Similarly, Saudi Arabia’s move to grant women the right to drive in 2018 was met with the arbitrary jailing and mistreatment of many of the country’s female #Women2Drive activists, exposing the dark reality behind glossy headlines around women’s emancipation in the region.Though setbacks persist, it clear that the gender issue is not going away, and, importantly, women’s issues are different today than they were in the 1990s. This is the case globally, and the Taliban and the Gulf are not immune from 30 years of women’s rights progress. In the Gulf, women’s rights issues and a wider array of rights concerns bubble under the surface, with top-down reforms subtly growing and responding to economic pressures as local activists continue their struggle. The Qatari Minister’s statement on girls’ education is just one indication that the Gulf is an important context for contestation and positioning on women’s issues in the region, which is different but not isolated from the situation in Afghanistan.These issues are highly political – as has been noted, the Taliban’s repression of women is in many ways ‘more tactical than ideological.’ This is also true of the Arab Gulf. Historical grievances, contestation over cultural identity, and economic shifts have meant that the ‘women question’ remains a breeding ground for political division in both contexts despite their vast differences. But they are also areas of potential transformative upheaval.Growing Muslim feminist movements are reaching beyond borders which once seemed impenetrable and offer some threads of hope that change is possible. Even the Taliban has had to bow and bend to the sway of global women’s rights discourse, offering some vague promises on gender equality, however empty. There is clearly a fear even among the Taliban of stepping too far out of line on women’s issues to become a global pariah. In the 1990s, this pressure was present but muted, with clamp downs rampant and even unapologetic. Today, Taliban leaders gave vague promises on women’s rights, brazenly pulling the rug as they are caught between competing pressures to play to international discourse while also exerting their strict interpretations of social order. These tensions are not going unnoticed by Taliban supporters and critics alike, and are clearly seen by domestic and global audiences.Overall, there is a sense that, if those aiming to support women in Afghanistan can exploit this desire for good image on gender equality, then there is hope for change. But it is also clear that these pressures can only go so far. Both hope and despair can be felt among women’s rights advocates in the Gulf, while despair heightens in Afghanistan. The two contexts, despite overwhelming differences, are not developing in isolation from one another, or from the global agendas within which they assert claims, and taken together can offer a deeper understanding of women’s rights around the world today.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/21/the-ethiopia-conflict-in-international-relations-and-global-media-discourse/,The Ethiopia Conflict in International Relations and Global Media Discourse,Jon Abbink,Nov 21 2021,"Since 4 November 2020, a devastating armed conflict has been raging in northern Ethiopia. Developments in this war, which started with a well-prepared nightly assault of the then-ruling Tigray Peoples Liberation Front (TPLF[1]) on federal army bases in Tigray Regional State, are going fast (see also Abbink 2021a, 3-4). The war was expanded by the TPLF into areas outside Tigray, where major abuses on local inhabitants were perpetrated. No end is yet in sight to the fighting, which had expanded deeper into the Amhara Region to the important cities of Dessie and Kombolcha by early November 2021. Although this conflict is primarily a domestic problem within an African state, there are ramifications towards neighbouring countries, such as Sudan, Somalia and Egypt. As Walt (1996) has argued, revolutions or domestic turmoil in a country can have a disruptive impact on international relations. Sudan has been manoeuvring at the Ethiopian border and Ethiopia’s withdrawal of troops from the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) force in Somalia has led to more terror activities by the Al Shabaab movement. But in turn, international relations can also have an impact on such a national crisis.The Ethiopia conflict has evoked a specific response pattern by the ‘international community’, primarily the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU) and the United Nations (UN): they address, or rather ‘target’, the Ethiopian government and not the insurgent TPLF which has caused most of the killing and destruction. A subsidiary role is played here by global media discourse toward this conflict, reporting haphazardly on a succession of events, but unconnected to historical lines and context of the state in question. Such reporting – in dominant news producing media like Reuters, AFP and AP (see Swiss Policy Research 2019) as well as global newspapers (see below) – often uncritically supported the insurgent TPLF, despite its appalling human rights record and its devastating campaigns against civilian populations. This again had an effect on international policymaking towards Ethiopia. Indeed, the omissions and failures of the global media and the (Western) international community which tend to blame the Ethiopian federal government for the armed conflict and the events since its outbreak, have an impact on the Ethiopian state and reveal a misplaced normative streak in international relations thinking among these actors. Especially remarkable in this case is the lack of commitment to the ideal of ‘democracy’ in international relations, nominally proclaimed by the USA and EU. This ideal was easily side-lined in their policy approaches to Ethiopia, as they de facto preferred the deeply undemocratic TPLF above the democratically elected government of Prime Minister (PM) Abiy Ahmed and the agenda of democratization that he implemented since in April 2018.This paper therefore argues that the media and policy approaches to this conflict demonstrate the weakness of the international system (including the UN) and of policy interventions. My supportive hypothesis is that media representation of the conflict and the international policy responses have also been inadequate, based on untested normative notions, superficial humanitarian concerns and lack of full factual evaluation. This in effect led to the conflict and the suffering being prolonged and contributed to endangering the future of the Ethiopian state.Notably the Western ‘donor country’ policymakers and the UN were selective and incomplete in their appraisal of the conflict and in diplomatic actions towards it, despite their alleged ‘concern’ for civilians as victims of violence and food scarcity in the first phase of the conflict. Especially the Ethiopian federal government, led since April 2018 by the reformist prime minister Abiy Ahmed, initially widely acclaimed as a leader and reconfirmed in credible elections in June 2021, has been blamed for the conflict by international parties, notably the USA, the EU and the global media. It is indeed worrying how the global news media, like CNN, AP, the New York Times, the Daily Telegraph, Le Monde and others have often played an obfuscating and biased role in reporting on thisyear-long conflict, e.g. by routinely accusing primarily the federal government of excesses. Numerous items in these media have distorted or misrepresented events in an incomplete and tendentious manner, akin to sensationalist and attention-grabbing not backed up by the facts or by proper investigation. These reports, in addition to the cyber ‘warfare’, and the repeated lecturing by Western countries of Ethiopia as the ‘bad guy’ taking on a smaller region (Tigray), reveal a measure of ignorance and misplaced ‘victim bias’, and evoke a host of questions not only on the interests of the global media but also (again) on the role of social media propaganda and on the workings of the international system and the UN.Most of those tabling resolutions, doing news items or writing press articles do not know much either – or perhaps do not care – about the history and complexity of Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa region (Hibist 2021). One major example is the neglect of the first mass killing that occurred in this conflict on 9 November 2020: an ‘ethnic cleansing’ operation in the town of Mai Kadra perpetrated by TPLF-affiliated militia on Amhara-speaking inhabitants (non-Tigrayans). An estimated 1500 non-combatants were killed, causing a shock effect throughout Ethiopia because of its exceptional nature. But this defining event and its implications are hardly discussed in the global media or in policy circles. Regarding this aspect of what often seems Western lecturing and selective outrage, recent controversial talking points are: a) US President Biden’s ‘Executive Order’ of 17 September 2021 announcing sanctions; b) the EU Parliament’s resolution of 8 October 2021 on ‘Tigray’, Ethiopia (RC9-0484/2021), and c) the expulsion of seven UN officials from Ethiopia on 30 September 2021, and d) recent USAEU resolution is an embarrassing document that does not take into account a whole range of facts on the ground regarding the war. It primarily shows a wish of EU parliamentarians (from left, right and centre) to score ‘moral points’: wanting to be seen as concerned about the civilian population in Tigray suffering for food scarcity. That is of course legitimate. But they stopped there and did not consider the equal if not much worse suffering from both mass displacement, food scarcity and gross violence that was seen in Afar and Amhara Regions. Those watching the debate in the EU Parliament on this resolution saw a level of ignorance hard to swallow, reflecting indeed a lingering neo-colonial mindset of Europeans towards an independent African country that ‘does not listen to the good-willing Europeans’. On the third point, an inquiry into the facts behind this decision of expelling UN personnel makes it clear that it was justified: several UN officials were transgressing the mandate of their function (e.g., in their assisting the TPLF insurgent leaders with several kinds of services, allegedly including in getting them advanced radar communications equipment[2]). They flouted the neutrality and professionalism that their job prescribes. The reactions from UN Secretary General A. Guterres, the EU and of course the ever-angry USA, were predictable.The USA gave an unconsidered response on the same day that the expulsion was announced, contesting the legitimacy. But the USA themselves have been expelling diplomats and UN staff left and right over the years.[3] It is also to be noted that in 1998, when the TPLF-EPRDF government expelled 30 UN officials, there was protest from the UN but no sound from the US or other foreign powers. The same in 2020 when Burundi expelled four UN functionaries. The indignation is also unproductive, because Ethiopia or any other nation has the right to expel such officials under Article 9 of the ‘Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations’, the UN resolution 46/182 of 1991 (‘Strengthening the coordination of humanitarian emergency assistance’; annex, articles 2 and 3), and the additional Memorandum of Understanding signed between the federal government and the UN. In any case, UN staff has no mandate under any law in any country to undermine the government, as these people have done.So, in general, the responses of the ‘international community’, notably the ‘donor countries’ of the EU and the USA in the current conflict in Ethiopia have been a problem and have even prolonged the conflict. Although the war started with that surreptitious attack by the TPLF (and collaborating Tigray soldiers) on sleeping soldiers of the federal army and the theft of numerous heavy weaponries, the TPLF was labelled as the ‘underdog’. There is still a peculiar ‘positive bias’ towards the TPLF and the Tigray Region, related to the alleged and real abuses in the first phase of the war and perceptions of the so-called ‘humanitarian aid blockage’ – which is a TPLF propaganda point disproved by the recent joint report of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission. However, the war and the gross human rights abuses are no longer there in Tigray – apart from serious food shortages and TPLF repression – but to the south, due to the TPLF expanding its campaigns there.When a unilateral ceasefire was offered by the Ethiopian federal government on 28 June 2021, followed by its troop withdrawal, the TPLF refused and mocked it. They took the opportunity to glorify their alleged military victory in Tigray and to extend the armed conflict into the Afar and northern Amhara regions outside Tigray – an unacceptable move endangering humanitarian aid routes and stabilization. This conflict is often labelled in global media as a ‘civil war’, but it is not: a civil war would be an all-out protracted fight between big parts of the country’s population against each other. But here we have an elitist, authoritarian movement – TPLF – that fights to retain its elite material interests and impunity against an elected federal government that contested its armedfar, the ongoing conflict has produced TPLF’s military expansion, which is however unlikely to be durable. It has also chiefly led to unspeakable civilian suffering and great material destruction in these two newly occupied areas. The expansion on several fronts seemingly had two purposes: a) ‘revenge’ – for having been defeated in the first months of the war and having been frustrated in their ultimate but questionable aim to march to Addis Ababa, and b) to induce the federal army to reassign troops from the Sudan-Wolqait[4] border to the north-central Amhara Region so as to force an opening for TPLF access to Sudan. This would have allowed TPLF to bring in troops (from the refugee camps, where several 10,000s of them seem to have been trained), and to bring in new arms and equipment. This failed, as the border remains virtually sealed.Meanwhile, the devastation in Afar and northern Amhara has continued and led to ongoing gross abuse of the local population in campaigns that the TPLF knew would not yield them durable military success. The fighting was hardly against federal troops because these were not stationed there in the initial weeks. The TPLF campaigns seemed intended to inflict maximum damage on local society, infrastructure, public facilities and village communities, including religious and cultural institutions. They were allegedly motivated by TPLF wanting to ‘break the humanitarian blockade of Tigray’ and ‘stop Tigray genocide’. But these are memes that do not have a real basis in fact, although the food scarcity in Tigray is serious. Many civilians in Amhara and Afar were arbitrarily killed by retreating TPLF units, churches and monasteries were attacked and looted, schools and clinics levelled, and all things of value taken by the TPLF troops and/or transported to Tigray. This is not the kind and scale of violence that happened in Tigray in the first phase of the war: indeed, there we saw transgressions and harsh suffering inflicted on the population but not purposeful destruction of communities and wanton mass killing of civilians. Serious incidents did occur in Tigray since the onset of the conflict – with people killed in the crossfire, abuse and gender-based violence, and food scarcity sharply increasing. But the federal government’s attorney-general’s office undertook prosecution of soldiers’ transgressions, and the government let in food aid to Tigray. The federal army also left huge supplies (including seeds for planting crops) when they left Meqele, the capital of Tigray. The army had neither pursued the scorched-earth tactics of destruction or massacres of civilians that we have seen perpetrated by TPLF in northern Amhara and Afar regions since 28 June 2021.There is an underlying ‘ethnic’ dynamic in this conflict, produced by 27 years of ethno-linguistic-based administrative federalism in Ethiopia (cp. Smith 2013; Bekalu 2018; Meckelburg & Abbink 2020). This political model has led to recognition of diversity but also to increasing group conflict based on the ‘politics of identity’. The armed conflict of the past year has exacerbated these antagonistic tendencies through the practices of extreme violence, with the TPLF specifically targeting Amhara communities by killing young people and destroying the economic bases of village life in the Amhara region. It led to new military mobilization of people in the Afar and Amhara Regions and thus to the entrenchment of conflict. This all poses a major challenge to the reform agenda proclaimed by the current prime minister and his party, aspiring for democratic politics, judicial reform, and national synergy in developing the country and its economy.The (Western) international community, however, has played a disappointing role, and seems to leave a longer-term strategic perspective on Ethiopia aside. They still carp on the things that happened earlier in Tigray, not adapting their narrative toward a balanced view on causes and effects. In Ethiopia (and Africa) this undermines trust in the West as a steady or reliable ‘development partner’. As we noted, the global news media do not help here, because they have tended to uncritically follow the pro-TPLF narrative, often not properly checking the facts on the ground, which reveal a much more complex picture. Policymakers and the UN have difficulty in striking a fair balance and tend to ignore discussions on the current misery in Amhara and Afar. Especially the responses of the USA are baffling. The UN, the State Department and USAID seem to stick to the story they were already telling in December 2020-January 2021: of demanding ‘unrestricted’, ‘unfettered access’ to Tigray for foreign aid organisations to ‘prevent famine’, and ‘prosecution of all federal army abuses’ in Tigray. As said, the federal government had already taken action on both points, despite that much remained to be done, hindered by the fighting and the repeated infrastructure sabotage of the TPLF.The US and other international players would do better to recognize that after 28 June 2021 the character of the war has significantly changed, and that TPLF’s escalation and abuse – from employing child soldiers (Fitz-Gerald and Segal 2021), civilian massacres, torture and rape, burning houses and crops to sabotaging communications, telecom, roads, or humanitarian aid transports – has been appalling. Policy needs to be adjusted. As far as food aid to Tigray is concerned, the ‘mystery’ of the disappearing food aid lorries is one of the latest scandals. The federal government, international NGOs and the UN WFP were doing their best to bring in more aid supplies to Tigray. As of 16 September, 466 trucks were sent to Tigray since late June, but only 38 returned. Two months later they still were not all back. Why? The WFP and other UN staff could not provide an answer, but they unconvincingly appeared to blame the inspection of the trucks by the federal army at checkpoints (needed to check on hidden arms and equipment). There are strong indications that what really happened was confiscation of the trucks by the TPLF to be used for their troop transports. Such facts are even not well-considered by the American ‘special envoy’ for the Horn of Africa, Jeffrey Feltman, who has so far not extended any serious pressure on the TPLF despite mounting evidence of their bad record, but only on the Ethiopian government. His visit on 4 November 2021 to Addis Ababa appears to have aimed at imposing an ultimatum on the federal government, as also his recent statement suggests. It was preceded by a US arms embargo on Ethiopia on 2 November and more sanctions on 12 November. But nothing on TPLF to speak of. This is not constructive diplomacy, because it threatens the existence of a sovereign nation and a (former?) USis somewhat puzzling that after 28 June 2021, hardly any serious international appeal was heard to TPLF to respect the ceasefire, de-escalate, protect food convoys to Tigray, or start thinking about an exit strategy to get back to a state of normality. The lack of encouragement or pressure on them meant that so far, no negotiations towards a peaceful solution are in sight. This was confirmed in a TPLF press appearance in Meqele on 1 October 2021, when TPLF army commanders, in sombre and delusional tones, announced the continuation of the struggle, at all cost. For what? No one knows. The federal government sees itself compelled to respond and defend the country. As long as positive signs towards credible negotiation, or surrender, or a radical political reset on the side of (part of) the TPLF are absent and Western/UN parties do not put pressure on them, the fighting and suffering will continue: in Tigray among a people held in a stranglehold by their self-serving leaders, and in the Afar and northern Amhara areas by an occupation that has no military aims and leads to death, economic destruction, and deep resentment. In recent weeks, cases of starvation among people in TPLF-devastated areas have also been heard.Ethiopia needs a fair deal from the international (Western) community and from the global media. Western (donor) countries, who always professed an interest in Ethiopia, its development, and its role in Africa, e.g., in the struggle against Islamist extremism and as an AU peace-keeping force (like in Darfur) should treat it as a partner, not as a patient in need that has to follow orders. The idea of ‘regime change’ that was recently even floated in US policy circles cannot be a part of such a partnership. Global media might try and improve their reporting and be less sensitive to propaganda points.What an analysis of this conflict in the Horn of Africa has made clear is that the global system of international relations is in crisis, is often susceptible to propaganda and cyber-space warfare, has a – what some people (such as Hibist 2021) say – is a neo-imperialist bias towards weaker (African) countries, lacks evidence-based background research or evaluations, and does not respond adequately to new challenges. Respecting the sovereignty of Ethiopia and its government, confirmed in democratic elections in June 2021 and developing a wider strategic view on Northeast Africa by Western powers would help. Hopefully, the mediation mission by AU envoy and former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo between TPLF and the federal government can crack an opening in the conflict, although there is some scepticism. It is likely that only military and diplomatic pressure on the TPLF will induce them to talk about any ‘negotiations’. In addition, the new PM Abiy-led Ethiopian government, installed on 4 October 2021 after the relatively successful parliamentary elections of June 2021, will not be inclined to yield to undue international pressure but strive to maintain the country’s integrity and pursue its broad reform agenda. The government will not give up on its national developmental trajectory and announced an inclusive ‘national dialogue process’, both of which could have a stabilizing effect not only on the country but also on international relations in the Horn and beyond."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/21/irish-american-diplomacy-and-the-catholic-orphanage-scandal/,Opinion – Irish-American Diplomacy and the Catholic Orphanage Scandal,Martin Duffy,Nov 21 2021,"Scandals involving diplomats and child protection issues are not uncommon. As recently as last year concern was expressed and remedial action on this issue sanctioned against certain foreign embassies in the UK. However, the subject of this article suggests a de facto policy on child adoption in the Irish state, implemented over a period of decades, which raises wider issues about the scrupulousness of the Irish-American diplomatic relationship. Predictably, it was the Associated Press, and not an Irish news outlet who broke the story on what was to become known as the “Tuam babies’ scandal”. Similar ad hoc cemetery sites have been uncovered at Bessborough and elsewhere. As forensic reports confirmed, “A mass grave containing the remains of babies and young children has been discovered at a former Catholic orphanage near Galway in Ireland”.The state began excavation in March 2017, and government-appointed investigators reported the first conclusive proof following a historian’s efforts to trace the fates of nearly 800 children who perished there. Catherine Corless, who exposed the scandal at the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, told the Irish Parliament that she was “naive” to believe that the bodies would be exhumed after they were discovered. Corless told the Committee of her “dismay” that the Tuam site was returned to its original condition following her discovery and that the remains were not respected. Some of the accounts of what was discovered in the initial investigations at Tuam are reminiscent of reports from conflict archaeologists from sites of political violence. Whereas these early childhood deaths occurred over a very lengthy period of time and only because of neglect, the actions of Bon Secour Sisters in consigning dead infants to an improvised mass grave, is shocking.Tuam is by no means an isolated case of mass graves of infants that perished having been left in the Irish state’s care. However, what is less widely appreciated is that this episode also uncovered a sophisticated international relations network involving the Foreign Service staff of the US State Department and its Embassy in Ireland and the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. These revelations shed an entirely new light on Ireland’s “special relationship” with the USA. Indeed, it was stated by a witness to the discovery of bundles of child passport applications in the state archives, that “a conspiracy of religious orders, pseudo-adoption agencies and diplomatic staff had created a web of secrecy akin to a spy network of such complexity it rivalled the resources of the FBI.” These applications are extraordinary in their volume, and that the widespread issuing of child passports required compliance on the part of the immigration authorities in the USA and Ireland.For much of the twentieth century in Ireland the moral imperative of concealing the stigma of conception outside marriage permitted a clandestine industry of adoption and emigration with the principal destination of these babies and young children being the USA. Concomitant with the international export of adoptees to the USA, living conditions for those left in the state’s care were disturbingly bad, resulting in appallingly elevated levels of childhood morbidity, in some instances even approaching a death rate of almost 50% of those in care. These are appallingly high figures of childhood morbidity, many times in excess of the figures for infant death in the general population. This suggests there was a fundamental neglect of the care needs of Irish children born out of wedlock, which is in juxtaposition to the highly regimented operation of international adoption.By comparison, the international dimensions of these activities have been neglected by analysts and yet the records point to a thriving international trade in babies and children, facilitated by the Foreign Service staffs of Ireland and the USA. In short, it is also an international relations scandal of a magnitude not previously appreciated by IR scholars of the period. It receives no attention in the speeches of American Presidents of the day and it hardly merits a record in the annals of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs. The records of these child passports, however, tell their own story which cannot beinternational relations studies hitherto have placed greater emphasis on the supportive role of the USA in bolstering the fledgling Irish Free state administration, and the welcome phenomena of remittance earnings coming back to Ireland from the many Irish legally and illegally laboring in the USA. It is less well known that a sophisticated international baby trade operation remained throughout this period an integral part of Irish-US relations. These sophisticated networks and tagging consular and airline staff with adoption agencies, required the compliance of Foreign Service staff of both countries, frequently endorsing grave breaches of international law.This trade also necessitated the falsification and rapid issue of passports for these babies and young children; redaction and modification of birth-dates to permit such international adoptions, and a sophisticated web of US and Irish Embassy and senior official endorsement of an adoption business which constituted the egregious violation of international law over a period of many decades. There is insufficient space in this article to even touch on the psychological pain inflicted on generations of these families by the “disappearance” of their babies and children, and the concealment and non-keeping of records which prevents their families now from establishing their identity.The remainder of this piece will address the involvement of Irish and American diplomats in this unsavory international trade, and the willingness of politicians and foreign service staff in both countries to sustain an international system which often endorsed “forced disappearance”. Moreover, these atrocities having been discovered because of the revelations from sites such as at Tuam and Bessborough, the international authorities in the USA and Ireland have actively prevented discovery of this international trade and have concealed the crucial role of the diplomatic service.It is unclear to what extent the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs actively conspired in the circumvention of international law and thereby knowingly facilitated the diaspora of “disappeared” in post-WW2 Ireland. However, the passport records of the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs reveal a barely concealed network of de facto child trafficking.Passports were issued at sometimes astonishing speed and with a confusing array of names almost at the command of Church-run adoption agencies.US and Irish diplomats, the aviation industry and “mother and baby homes” were part of an elaborate network which existed outside the exegesis of official law. It was as if an alternative international order existed, sanctioned by the Pope, and which required a very minimal compliance with the normal procedures of international order. To dispatch each child on its journey from Ireland to a new life in America, at a time when the US was solidifying its international borders, required a high level of compliance by both jurisdictions. Officials in Washington and Dublin cannot but have been aware that this was, in effect, an international adoption network between America and the “old country”.One may reflect on the sad history of the Mother and Baby homes in Ireland as we are confronted with the legacy of personal suffering and face the realities of enormous financial compensation, presenting a burden on the Irish tax-payer for decades to come. In this environment the moral repugnance of the Irish Free State and its hypocritical stance towards unmarried pregnancy has left the nation with a heavy cost and a painful conscience. Internationally, it also exposes diplomacy, directly or indirectly, in the service of a grisly international trade, as exposed in “Philomena”, Stephen Frears’ Oscar-nominated film.One might therefore assume that over such a period of time, lessons would be learned and a cost paid in eternal vigilance on such matters as personal morality and human trafficking. Sadly, Ireland remains an oft-overlooked destination country for women, men, and children trafficked for the purposes of commercial sexual exploitation and forced labor. In 2018 and 2019 the United States Department of State’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons (OMCTP) noted that Ireland failed, “the minimum standards for the elimination ofis as if an international conspiracy of silence condemned the island to repetition of the sins of its past. The same variables of international child adoption, although increasingly from third countries to Ireland, still today cast a dark shadow on Ireland’s contemporary human rights performance. Nowadays we have much stricter measures of child protection and procedures to deter malfeasance in public office. However this dark shadow in Ireland’s diplomatic past and which questions the credentials of the Irish-American relationship, is a challenge for today.Diplomats in every country must be vigilant in ensuring the highest standards of policy where potential child trafficking could be missed. There is compelling evidence from the OMCTP that Ireland has work to do to strengthen its current procedures. This historical narrative of a dark chapter in Ireland’s immigration history is compelling but also has resonance for today. The denial of a respectful burial to the dead of the Mother and Baby Homes suggests that a prevalent public morality and the stigma of procreation out of wedlock, was given precedence over the most basic acts of humanity. That Irish-American diplomacy contributed to an elaborate network of child adoption casts a dark shadow over what is otherwise hailed as a formative period in the relationship between the two nations.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/20/considering-democracy-and-power-in-light-of-the-kyle-rittenhouse-acquittal/,Considering Democracy and Power in Light of the Kyle Rittenhouse Acquittal,Ali E. Erol,Nov 20 2021,"Under a feudal system, such as a fiefdom or a kingdom, a monarch would justify its power over people and over land by the idea of divine right—that the king took his authority from whatever divinity was associated with that particular political or cultural entity. The line of authority flowed from above: just as the monarch bowed to the rule of the divine, at least in appearance, people under his rule bowed to him. In a way, obedience to the king was obedience to the divine itself. Kings and rulers obviously abused hell out of this authority, from wars to genocides. But what gave the king ultimate authority was his ability to take life—if the king wanted someone’s head on a pike, that person was getting their head on a pike. This ability to take life or grant life was an early conceptualization of the state’s monopoly over violence. In other words, whatever was the king’s decision and authority over taking life and the monopoly over the ability to take life transferred into, got translated into the criminal justice system in modern bourgeois democracies. This is still present in the form of capital punishment in some states, for example, and in other places we see this in police’s and military’s ability to take human life with whatever justification and in most cases with little or no consequence. But a king’s authority over human life during feudalism, also translated into the instrumentalization and the implementation of the incarceral state in the present moment.As Foucault notes, in Discipline & Punish, the punishment that was considered appropriate, over time, went from physical to mental or spiritual. Regardless, this evolution meant that the “ancient right to take life or let live was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death,” as Foucault, writes in History of Sexuality, Vol. 1., through the criminal justice system. This is what Foucault calls biopower, the ability to arrange the social, cultural, economic, and legal structures such that the intersection of these contexts make some lives thrive while they make others die. Adaptation of biopower into the structures of governance gives the current political systems the appearance of being civilized and democratic because the power over life is not as explicit as it was during the feudal times and now it is even made invisible within endless pages of bureaucratic record keeping, in thousands of pages of legal codes, tax codes, and labor practices.Biopower reached its peak of self-expression during Europe’s fascist period, which coincided with the rising of kkk violence against Black people in the US—all the way to the mid-1900still the freedom movement (otherwise known as civil rights movement, although Angela Davis, for example, does not like the term civil rights because she says it makes liberation sound like accumulating rights) put an end to more explicit forms of racism, such as the commonplace lynchings. In fascist dictatorships, death was a goal in itself. It did not serve a larger narrative such as the economy of the country or liberation from an oppressive or invasive force. Death and erasure in themselves were valuable goals to pursue. This was, in a way, a fetishization of biopower—that the value of taking life was moved from a justification of development, sacrifice, or national liberation to being valuable in and for itself. Gas chambers and death camps were the ultimate show of biopower. They committed genocide because they could mobilize all kind of historical narratives to make regular people want to kill others in a show of having power over life. They committed genocide because they could.One of the ways in which three fascist regimes in Europe—Spain, Italy, and Germany—were able to take power and really display the extent to which they would utilize biopower was through this thing called “state of exception” or “state of emergency” rule. Giorgio Agamben draws our attention to how these states of exceptions developed over time, starting as exceptions then becoming the norm. State of exception rule was first established during the French Revolution—it has been woven into the very fabric of constitutional regimes since then. It is basically the idea that under extreme circumstances where the ruling body needs to take decisive action, the law can suspend itself with certain limitations, so that decisive action can be taken without losing precious time with deliberation. Similar clauses popped up in French law, periodically, until the First World War. When the First World War was taking place, pretty much every country in Europe adopted a kind of clause that suspended their laws for the duration of the war.Unsurprisingly, after the First World War, the governments wanted to hold on to at least some of the power they had gained by the enacted states of emergencies during the war—and consequently pretty much all countries in Europe ended up having a version of this law that granted ruling body a ridiculous amount of power while at the same time suspending the law that applied to everyone and governed day to day life. But, during interwar years (that is, between the first and the second world wars), fascist groups, starting with Mussolini, began stirring up violence using paramilitary groups. Mussolini was himself a veteran of the First World War and it did not take long for him to find other veterans who were disgruntled and upset that Italy did not get enough after the war. They had fought and suffered and Italy was short changed during the peace process. That narrative struck a chord with other veterans. A paramilitary group called “Blackshirts”—which later influenced Hitler’s “Brownshirts”, but they were both inspired by Russia’s “Black Hundreds”, a proto-fascist group in Russia that took a pro-Tsarist position during late 1800s and embodied many fascist ideals—was formed and it didn’t take long for Mussolini to take control of that group.blackshirts would attack workers in factories, unions, and socialists and then they would claim self defense. These attacks would take place in more rural places where it was easier to drown out the truth with rumors, where a nascent visual media would not be able to reach. With these attacks, they were able to shift the public opinion against socialists and against Jewish people. With media propaganda, they were successful in showing themselves as the defenders of law, order, safety, and security from the agitation and violence they had caused. Once the public opinion was shifted in favor of the fascists, and once they accumulated enough votes, they claimed a “state of emergency” in their countries, one by one, to take charge and consolidate power in their own hands and to make every other party or thought illegal. When this was unfolding, paramilitary groups acted as state-sanctioned vigilante groups that sought and harassed, assaulted, and killed socialists, Jewish people, and union organizers. Because they had aligned with the state’s ideology, anything they did were not only forgiven but were actively condoned—the police and the courts turned away while vigilantes did most of the dirty work. After consolidation of power, these vigilante groups were absorbed into the regular military of the state.This further solidified the idea that the monopoly over violence that the state had through its repressive apparatuses, such as the police and the army, would and could be extended to citizens who aligned with state’s ideology and objectives and preferred identity positions. In other words, those individuals and groups who did not have the legal authority to use violence, still could as long as they aligned with the state—as long as they were good citizens within the parameters of that state’s ideology. So, not only the state could exert biopower through official means, but also others could take it upon themselves to exert state-brand violence wherever and whenever they would see fit with the full knowledge that the legal, social, political, and cultural context would not condemn them. Because that is how biopower works, it creates the conditions for some to thrive and others to die.In the post-war period, this was, obviously, disturbing. Except for Spain, who would remain under fascist Franco rule until his death in 1975, Europe moved to choosing sides in the cold war and central and western europe picked the ‘respectful and dignified’ side of the US—maybe it had something to do with Marshall Plan (also called ‘European Recovery Program’), which was a plan that got put into action in 1948 that gave a lot of money to Europe (114 billion in today’s money), to rebuild war torn countries in the hopes that they’d fall under US influence. That turned out to be an accurate assessment of the next 50 years, until the collapse of the Soviet Block. Consequently, during and after the Second World War, bourgeois democracies adopted a form of state of exception laws to prevent something like the hollacaust from happening again, from fascist dictators to take power again after stirring up violence and claiming self defense.But these laws did nothing more than increase the state’s powers over time. However, it is important to keep in mind that the law wouldn’t have been able to be suspended, if it didn’t have the capacity to be suspended to begin with. In other words, law’s capacity to suspend itself creates a legal atmosphere whereby the suspension of law by whatever justification becomes the legal regime itself. That is exactly what it is to live in a bourgeois “democracy” that can suspend the law as it sees fit whenever it wants. Within the constraints of the US constitution, these kinds of acts are done with the justification of Article I, Section 9, Clause 2, called the “suspension clause”: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” This means that whenever those who are in power need to justify suspending the functioning of the law, they justexample, in the US, state of emergency law was used during the Second World War by President Eisenhower to issue Executive Order 9066 that enabled Japanese internment camps. For that to have happened, the Executive Order 9066 needed to have the legal capacity or standing to suspend the laws that protected the rights of certain groups of people due to a justification like national security. After 9/11, George W. Bush passed the “patriot act” that consolidated a lot of power within the government, expanding the security and the surveillance apparatuses of the state. Based on this, a lot of random Muslims, especially in NYC, were randomly taken into custody by the FBI because their names sounded similar to those who committed the attacks—they were interrogated, in some cases deported.Using these states of emergencies and suspending the law, those who are in power, the state, extends the circumference of the biopower they can justifiably use. One thing to note, however, states of emergencies that suspend the law and, consequently, the targets of the expending biopower are always those who do not align with the state, state’s ideology, and privileged identity groups—those who are deemed as enemies, racial minorities, leftists, religious minorities. Meanwhile, those who are aligning with the state and those who are taking it upon themselves to use and impose the biopower bestowed upon them by the state, those who are blessed as the champions of the statist ideology are protected and shielded from legal, social, or cultural consequence because they are implicitly protected by the shadow of the state of emergency that hums in the background of the socio-legal order. This has been the case with George Zimmerman to Kyle Rittenhouse, this has been the case when Proud Boys coordinate with the police to beat up Antifa, just like it had been the case ever since those who embodied state’s monopolized violence lynched, raped, murdered and simply walked away with a badge of honor attached to their lapel by the loving hands of the paternal state himself. It keeps happening. This is the norm. This is what democracy means and this is why the word democracy itself becomes a protective shield to support the status quo and the accusations of being anti-democratic can be wielded against those who do not align with US interests—internally or externally.In other words, it is okay if a paramilitary group or a person decides to showcase state’s biopower on those who are deemed surplus or disposable, since the law always will bend or suspend itself in order to protect those who align themselves with its power, those who act as the extensions of its power. This is also apparent in the ongoing Ahmaud Arbery case—where three white men cut off and killed a Black jogger while he was jogging—the defendant’s lawyer was able to invoke history of lynchings against Black people in the US and liken three white defendants to Black people who were lynched. Turning history on its head, sure. But by doing so, brilliantly showing who has the right to live and who can only have the right to die. When Black people were getting lynched, the lynching was acceptable. Black people had the right to be lynched and through the extension of state of exception to those who enforce state’s biopower, those white people who would do the lynching would get a celebration and lynching postcards. Now that the lynching is unacceptable, the cruel language gets weaponized against a Black person who was actually killed by a white mob and against the understandable anger directed towards a justice system that is built on criminalizing people of color.Whatever ends up happening with the Arbery case, even if there are convictions, we will know that those convictions happened not because the criminal justice system wanted to make people of color feel safer, but because, in this case, the murderers did not cover their tracks well enough and the case was beyond the criminal justice system’s saving grace. After the murder, the local prosecutor refused to press charges, the police didn’t investigate and the three white men who killed Ahmaud Arbery weren’t even arrested. If the video of the shooting didn’t go viral, nobody would have cared about Arbery’s death, further proving how the law conveniently suspends itself in different directions when it comes to people who embody and enforce the biopower that aligns with the state’s ideology, historical existence and privileged identity positions.What happens? What is the social or cultural consequence? Do we wake up tomorrow and go about our days, like we did after every person of color whose murder by a repressive state aparatus, legal or otherwise, was swept under the rug?The state of exception, that was historically meant to denote rare cases, is the rule—has been the rule, has been the context in which the law existed not as an independent institution, but as an extension of the state’s ideology precisely because crises that demand states of exception are easily and readily manufactured to work around the law. And the law only exists against those who cannot be covered by the state of exception to begin with. As such, the state’s biopower can be used against its eternal enemies: people of color, leftists, women, unionists, sex workers, neurodivergents, homeless, working class people, etc. And because the state of exception is the rule, the consequences of exerting biopower are suspended—violence stays within the state’s monopoly, now extended tomore these socio-legal mechanisms reveal that contemporary bourgeois democracy is an illusion of modernity, is an illusion of painting the present as the lack of the past—but as we keep seeing the present moment is a mere repetition of the racist, sexist, classist past—then will it embolden further reactionary and regressive politics that yearn for a past that has never actually left us in the first place? Will they long to wear and express the symbols of the past? Will the desire to bring back that past and materialize it in movements that would like to Make America <live in the past more explicitly> Again?In Open Veins of Latin America, Eduardo Galeano writes that “History is a prophet who looks back: because of what was, and against what was, it announces what will be.” In the opening of his work Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, Marx writes “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” What about 4 centuries of repetition? What about brutal consistency? What about countless genocides, not only repeating from one massacre to another but also the individual pain within each instant repeated millions of times? What is farce to the power of infinite?Inversely, what would it mean to live in a regime in which the state of exception does not exist and the legal structure cannot make exceptions for those who want to take a slice of the monopolized violence pie by exerting state’s biopower against minorities? What would it look like to live in a place where people cannot be disposed of because they are defined as disposable? At what point do we stop repeating? At what point do we stop repeating not because the system gets fixed but because we stop trying to exist with it and within it? What happens then? "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/20/opinion-merkel-talks-with-lukashenka-a-positive-or-negative-step/,Opinion – Merkel Talks with Lukashenka: A Positive or Negative Step?,David R. Marples,Nov 20 2021,"A flurry of communication over the past few days has taken place between the EU and the de facto leader of Belarus, Aliaksandr Lukashenka, led by the Acting Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel. The result has been a partial easing of the tense situation at the Belarusian-Polish border and the dismantling of migrant camps. It does not mean the crisis is over. Hundreds of migrants remain in the forests though some have been returned to Iraq while others have been moved to a warm building as a temporary shelter.Several countries, led by Poland, as well as the Belarusian opposition have objected to the communication with Lukashenka in the belief that it breaks an agree EU policy of sanctions and isolation of a leader who has responded viciously to the protests against the disputed results of the 2020 presidential elections, interned over 7,000 political prisoners, beaten and tortured dozens, and hijacked a Ryanair flight from Athens to Vilnius last May to arrest Raman Pratasevich, one of the coordinators of the election protests through his Telegram NEXTA channel on social media.In fomenting the crisis Lukashenka clearly anticipated that he would get a response from the EU. His goal is not so much ending the migrant issue or recognition of his continuing presidency, but the removal of sanctions and renewed dialogue. Over past months, he has been limited to communication with, and increasing reliance on, his one remaining ally, Vladimir Putin’s Russia, with the result that he is now fully dependent on Moscow for his survival and that of his Security Council. Lukashenka’s role has diminished from one of a reluctant and demanding ally to a junior partner that offers slavish praise for a powerful boss. The balance of power in short has moved to Moscow.Since 2017, Lukashenka’s position has evolved from a subtle politician adopting a carefully balanced path between Russia and the EU–with links also to China and the Middle East–that has allowed him to manoeuvre between them to a political leader that has lost his way. In this same period, his policies have become flawed and desperate, beginning with his lack of response to the Covid-19 virus, which is still at a critical phase in the country, and continuing with fabricated assassination plots and inventing a Hamas threat to an international flight to hijack an airliner. The sustained crackdown has elicited new sanctions imposed by the EU, the UK, United States, and Canada, none of which recognizes his as president.Also factored into the equation is his Lukashenka’s electoral opponent, the neophyte politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaia, who has remained active outside Belarus, visiting various Western capitals in a sustained campaign to keep them aware of the political crisis and opposition to Lukashenka’s continuing rule. Lukashenka has managed to quash all attempts to remove him within the country, but is helpless to stop what is happening beyond its borders. Tsikhanouskaia has been well received from Washington, DC to Warsaw, and her intelligent and sincere speeches have evoked positiveresponse, the latest resort of Lukashenka has been to manufacture a new crisis by reversing his much-touted policy of protecting Europe from migrants and the dispersal of drugs, and encouraging would-be refugees (Kurds, Iraqis, Syrians, and others) to fly to Belarus before transporting them to the border, and sometimes providing them with wire cutters and even weapons to penetrate the Polish border guards.Poland’s response was predictably firm and played into Lukashenka’s hands as Belarusian TV could display images of armed units firing water cannons or tear gas into crowds that included high numbers of women and children. The images might as well have flashed the slogan “this is Europe” over the screen. Poland by tradition has accepted very few refugees from the conflicts in the Middle East, Africa, or Afghanistan. In fact, most migrants are attempting to reach Germany rather than Poland.Merkel’s intervention therefore deserves more than knee-jerk condemnation. It was necessary for prompt action, which likely would have been impossible had she discussed her plans with Poland and other EU members beforehand. The immediate humanitarian crisis has been averted. And there is no suggestion either in Minsk or in Germany that the two phone calls (15 and 17 November) implied the recognition of Lukashenka’s legitimacy. Rather, Germany was dealing with the only person–other than his Cabinet–who could conceivably change the situation.What is key, however, is that communication should not presage the commencement of a longer-term strategy of renewed engagement or dialogue with the regime in Minsk in its current form. Merkel also talks regularly with Putin. Relations between the two countries are closer than those between the EU eastern borderland countries and Moscow. Resolution of a problem created by the regime in Minsk is unlikely to be determined without Russia’s assent, and thus it is beneficial to have open two windows of communication, namely between Berlin and Moscow, and Berlin and Minsk, as long as it does not negate the unity and decision-making power of the EU.Those who have condemned Merkel’s initiative also need to consider one question: how can the wider political crisis in Belarus be alleviated? Since the protests on the street could not continue, there is no obvious answer from within the country. The Russian-backed regime may continue indefinitely, with or without sanctions, as long as it uses force and repressions as a deterrent to regime change and resists Russia’s plans for closer integration. Even at their height, the mass protests never resorted to violence, thus regime change was unlikely unless the army or security forces turned on Lukashenka. They proved too closely linked to the regime to take such a fateful step.If change is to come, it requires interventions from external sources, the most likely of which is Russia, however unlikely that may appear at present.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/18/opinion-the-status-of-the-brics-20-years-later/,"Opinion – The Status of the BRICS, 20 Years Later",William Daldegan and Carlos Eduardo Carvalho,Nov 18 2021,"November 30, 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the article that popularized the acronym BRICS. When Jim O’Neill claimed that ‘it is time for the world to build better global economic BRICs’ he referred to Brazil, Russia, India and China as dynamos of global growth for the following decade, potential destinations for international investments, and as a pressure factor for expanding ‘the key body of global economic policy co-ordination’, the G-7. However, two decades later O’Neill (Project Syndicate, 09/16/21) was tough: ‘The bloc’s ongoing failure to develop substantive policies through its annual summitry has become increasingly glaring’. O’Neill pointed out low trade integration, unequal growth, little assertiveness in the face of the international order, a lack of coordination concerning priority issues, and a missed opportunity to form strategic cooperation agreements. And he asked, ‘When is that influence going to show up?’However, it is possible to assess the BRICS trajectory from another perspective: as an initiative that recognizes the huge differences between its members and is developed according to the resultant possibilities. In September 2021 the BRICS held their 13th consecutive Annual Summit, fifteen years after the first meeting of the original members – Brazil, Russia, India, China, with the subsequent incorporation of South Africa. Each Summit issued a declaration, with positions on topical and global issues. Almost all summits were attended by countries geographically close to the hosting one.The BRICS formed several working groups and promoted hundreds of thematic meetings. In 2014, the Contingent Reserve Agreement (CRA) was created to stimulate liquidity in times of crisis, and the New Development Bank (NDB), which is currently negotiating the adhesion of Bangladesh, the UAE and Uruguay, to support infrastructure and sustainable development projects. Hooijmaaijers claimed that while the expansion of cooperation through thematic groups and meetings and the creation of the NDB and CRA internally strengthen the BRICS, the opening to other countries and the integration of the NDB into the network of international financial institutions externally reinforce this institutionalization. The behavior patterns, the recurrence and constancy of interactions, and the reach of the group’s actions reflect its resilience.These efforts may seem modest for five countries that represent approximately 24% of global GDP. However, this number can be a bit misleading as half of the percentage is attributable to China, and the growth rate is extremely uneven: Brazil, Russia and South Africa have generally disappointed, whereas China and India maintain high rates of GDP growth, contradicting O’Neill’s original argument in 2001. Trade among the five BRICS is minimal when bilateral flows with China are excluded, and specific measures toward intra-bloc trade were limited. There were serious divergences of opinion concerning sensitive issues on the international agenda that involved one or more partners, such as the Annexation of Crimea, in addition to the aggressive hostility of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro toward the Chinese government and the violent border rows between India and China.Why then do these five countries have annual summits and related declarations, a multilateral development bank, and working groups? The analysis of the BRICS’s performance should begin with looking at the characteristics of the group and its intentions since the initial meeting in 2006 and the adoption of a common identity in 2008. The original acronym proposed by O’Neill was endorsed, but according to their own rules, and not as a trade and investment agreement or as a formal alliance. It aimed to use its political and economic weight to exploit opportunities created by the G20 in the cracks that appeared as a result of the 2007-2008 financialextreme heterogeneity of the five countries allowed for a completely original arrangement. Distinct perceptions of a global scenario do not limit strategies and initiatives, but rather reflect the limits of the individual interests of each member. Even though members do not consider the arrangement as a priority in their foreign policy, they continue to support it. The five countries signed agreements both between themselves and independently of the group – RCEP (China, Japan, Australia, New Zeland and six ASEAN Member States), SCO (China, Índia and Russia with Kazakhstan, Kyrcyz, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan), AfCFTA (South Africa and 35 AU Members States), IBSA (India, Brazil and South Africa), and EU-Mercosur (Brazil). The absence of formal institutionalization allows for advances and retreats in different themes and contexts, which reduces the potential for friction and increases resilience.Strategic themes such as health, education, trade and energy have been debated. Debates between think tanks from the five countries support the proposal of cooperation projects. The NDB reinforces the discourse in favor of reformed multilateralism in which developing countries would have greater participation, with fair and equal treatment of issues and weight in decisions. At the NDB the cooperation in infrastructure and sustainable development are implemented and geopolitical issues that guarantee friction between members have been abandoned.It is not possible to categorize the BRICS as an international institution, regime or organization. We defend the idea that the BRICS is a dynamic and in process phenomenon: dynamic because it is developed according to the members’ perceptions of the world scenario, without defining the limitations surrounding the strategies and initiatives of each member country; and in process because it is developed through specific processes, in which members do not determine end goals or institutionalization.Cooper and Farroq defend the BRICS as an informal club for managing tensions among its members and promoting cooperation in a new and flexible type of multilateralism. The reduced number of members allows for the discussion of common themes and interests. Sensitive topics are avoided or dealt with according to protocol. For each member, the arrangement reinforces their status nationally and internationally. The countries are part of a select group of representatives from the Global South, that share exclusive assets, such as status resulting from NDB cooperation and resources, maintain the CRA as a guarantee, and exploit the informal nature of the BRICS to protect the diverse interests.During the Covid-19 pandemic, China and India both developed vaccines and were the main suppliers of inputs for the vaccine, other medicines and personal protective equipment (PPE) in Brazil and South Africa. Appeared in 2018 and resumed in 2020, given the pandemic scenario, the proposal to create a disease alert center and vaccine development was not implemented. At the Summit, President Bolsonaro highlighted the relevance of Chinese inputs for the national production of immunization agents in Brazil in addition to the cooperation with India. Bolsonaro’s statement clashed with the aggressively anti-China policy he had pursued since the election campaign.At the Summit, the BRICS established a Counter-Terrorism Action Plan, which was a particularly relevant issue for India, given the changes in Afghanistan. The BRICS took a stand in the defense of dialogue and diplomacy for conflict resolution and peace building, while Russia and China opened channels of dialogue in order to influence the new government. Regarding Brazil and India’s demand for a seat in the UNSC, China and Russia support the discourse on the need for more democratic governance structures, but without the formal and explicit support necessary to bring the issue to debate.O’Neill’s criticism would have merit if the BRICS collation intended to be a trade deal or achieve recognition from the G7, but this was neither what they intended nor what they aim toReading on E-International RelationsWhy the West Struggles to Understand the BRICSClosing the Second Cycle in BRICS: A Surprise or Business as Usual?Strategic Narratives of the BRICS: A Visual AnalysisAdding ‘T’ to BRICS: A NATO Ally in TransitionHow the BRICS Exert Influence in the Global Politics of DevelopmentOpinion – Can the Coronavirus Crisis Revive Multilateralism?About The Author(s)William Daldegan is a Professor at the Federal University of Pelotas (UFPel), International Relations Graduate and Postgraduate Program in Political Science and leader of the Research Group on Economics, Politics and International Development in Brazil.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/17/the-lasting-repercussions-of-kazakhstans-nuclear-disarmament/,The Lasting Repercussions of Kazakhstan’s Nuclear Disarmament,Wilder Alejandro Sanchez,Nov 17 2021,"As 2021 draws to a close, the Central Asian states are celebrating three decades of independence from the former Soviet Union. One additional cause worth celebrating is that Central Asia is a nuclear weapons-free region. This development can also be traced back to 1991 as, on 29 August, the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site in the Republic of Kazakhstan was officially closed. Led by President Nursultan Nazarbayev at the time, Kazakhstan is one of the few nations that voluntarily gave up its nuclear arsenal, which makes the country a global trendsetter of disarmament diplomacy and nuclear non-proliferation. While a world without nuclear weapons is difficult to imagine, it is important to continue working towards nuclear disarmament by learning from successful examples.According to the International Security Research Center’s Nuclear Threat Initiative, Kazakhstan had 1,410 nuclear warheads within its territory after the fall of the USSR. Moreover, according to Joseph P. Harahan’s With Courage and Persistence, the Soviets had installed,nuclear testing and storage facilities at Kokshetau, a nuclear breeder reactor at Agtan, several missile tracking and monitoring stations, a nuclear manufacturing complex at Ust-Kamenogorsk, a chemical weapons production plant in Pavlodar, and biological weapons plants and institutes in Stepnogorsk and Almaty.Upon coming to power, the new government led by Nazarbayev realized that it had to decide what to do with this vast nuclear arsenal and infrastructure. “Within the Kazakh government in 1991, few if any ministers or elected officials knew the full extent of these military-industrial enterprises, military forces, […] and especially the nuclear weapons and uranium storage areas. Everything had been kept secret,” Harahan explains.Four developments that occurred between 1992–1994 would have lasting repercussions on Kazakhstan, eventually transforming the country into a regional leader with global aspirations and influence. Firstly, Russia’s political and economic crises during the Boris Yeltsin years (1991-1999) meant that Russian personnel could not protect or maintain nuclear sites and weapons abroad. “At the Baykonur cosmodrome, launch sites and facilities deteriorated from lack of funds, harsh winter conditions and the absence of skilled technical personnel,” Harahan explains. This situation convinced President Nazarbayev that the status quo could not continue as Kazakhstan hosted, but not controlled, this unprotected destructive technology.Secondly, changes in Central Asian geopolitics, with the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, and better relations between Kazakhstan and China. As Harahan explains, “these military and diplomatic developments [diminished] perceptions that Kazakhstan was a weak, vulnerable nation.” The START treaty, Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and other similar documents, also gave Kazakhstan a sense ofRussian military commanders monitored the aforementioned developments and chose to relocate strategic equipment, like the Tu-95M bombers and missiles out of Kazakhstan and back to Russia. And, Fourthly, closer relations between Kazakhstan and the United States. In mid-December 1991 US Secretary of State James Baker traveled to Almaty, then the country’s capital, to meet with President Nazarbayev, to discuss the advantages of denuclearization. Moreover, Harahan explains, “since nuclear non-proliferation lay at the heart of U.S. foreign policy objectives, Baker assured Nazarbayev the United States would grant diplomatic recognition and move quickly to have an American ambassador and an embassy staff in place and working in Kazakhstan.”Kazakhstan transferred its last nuclear warhead to Russia in April 1995. Moreover, the Semipalatinsk test site was dismantled, as well as the other nuclear and biological & chemical weapon production facilities. This was unprecedented cooperation between Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and the United States, something almost unthinkable nowadays. Togzhan Kassenova, an expert on nuclear politics andnon-proliferation and senior fellow with the Project on International Security, Commerce, and Economic Statecraft at the University at Albany, has written a book (2022) Atomic Steppe: How Kazakhstan gave up the Bomb that analyzes and explains the causes and consequences of this historical disarmament.While not the focus of this analysis, it is important to highlight how over 450 nuclear tests carried out by the Soviet military had tragic consequences on the health of Kazakhstanis at the time, and continue to leave lasting effects today. During a 9 September online event titled “Kazakhstan: How Events 30 Years Ago Spurred Action to Halt Nuclear Testing Worldwide,” organized by the Arms Control Association, Kassenova noted that in 1992, the government passed a law to assist the victims of Soviet nuclear tests. This law is vital for the “recognition of the sacrifice [of Kazakhstanis and also had] legal provisions in terms of who is identified as a victim of the tests and what kind of benefits they could receive.” She highlights how the legacy of the nuclear tests is not an issue that has been fully resolved and “more needs to be done.”One interesting fact is that the Central Asian Nuclear Weapons-Free Zone (CANWFZ) treaty, established in 2006, was signed in Semipalatinsk. Voluntarily giving up its nuclear arsenal and technology had long-term consequences for Kazakhstan and the greater Central Asia region. As Harahan explains, “Russia’s withdrawal of strategic bombers and rocket forces, its commitments to compensation and its pledge of security guarantees for the territorial integrity of the new nation” strengthened Kazakhstan and allowed it focus away from defense and to develop the country’s oil and gas resources. Nowadays, Kazakhstan is the most developed in the region, a major producer of oil, gas, and uranium; provides military personnel for the UN mission in Lebanon (UNIFIL); and is primed for global investment.Disarmament also permitted Kazakhstan to develop multi-vector foreign policies to constructively engage with China, Central Asian nations, Europe, and the United States. Harahan adds “President Nazarbayev not only signed and secured ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty; he became a leader in the region advocating arms control treaties, weapons agreements, diplomatic alliances and cooperative programs.” For example, Kazakhstan is known for hosting the Astana Peace Process, aimed at peacefully resolving the Syrian conflict.In mid-November, the Kazakhstani embassy in Seoul, South Korea, and the Library of the First President of Kazakhstan organized a Nuclear-Free World photo exhibition. The exhibition “is dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Independence of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the closure of the Semipalatinsk nuclear test site.”This exhibition highlights how proud Kazakhstan is of its decision three decades ago, and how it changed the course of not only Kazakhstani but also Central Asianpreviously mentioned, Kazakhstani foreign policy has made the promotion of non-proliferation a pillar of its foreign policy. The country has developed close relations with Japan to promote nuclear disarmament. Kazakhstan is also linked to Germany and Sweden as nations that “have made strides toward a common framework on the next steps on nuclear disarmament.”Emmanuelle Maitre, from theFondation pour la Recherche Strategique, argues,Because of its status of [non-nuclear weapon state and] also its close links with [nuclear weapon states], Kazakhstan sees itself as a potential mediator between both groups of states, a ‘bridge-builder,’ able to strike compromises by promoting the importance both of non-proliferation and disarmament.On 16 December, Kazakhstan will celebrate its 30th independence anniversary, a historical occasion. As for the world, another 30th anniversary, namely the closure of the Semipalatinsk test site, must also be remembered. Looking to the future, the prospects of nuclear disarmament appear grim, as the countries that still possess nuclear weapons have shown very little interest in eliminating their stockpiles. Thus reduction, rather than total disarmament, is a more logical objective. To achieve this, it will be important that the global community lobby and pressure nuclear states about the importance of the reduction of nuclear arsenals, and it is important for Kazakhstan to continue sharing its own successful post-nuclear record. While the geopolitical situation of Kazakhstan and most nuclear states, particularly the three global powers, is vastly different, there are valuable lessons that can be learned.The views presented in this article are the author’s own.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/17/opinion-bidens-blunder-on-ethiopia/,Opinion – Biden’s Blunder on Ethiopia,Worku Aberra,Nov 17 2021,"Opinion – Biden’s Blunder on EthiopiaThe Biden administration claims to oppose dictatorship and to support democracy throughout the world, but in Ethiopia it is supporting an armed insurrection by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) against the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The TPLF, a political group that claims to represent less than 6% of Ethiopia’s population, controlled the Ethiopian army, security apparatus, and the economy for almost three decades from 1991 to 2018. It ruled Ethiopia with an iron fist through a coalition of four ethnic parties it created. UnderTPLF rule, Ethiopia was “one of the most inhospitable places in the world, bearing the hallmark of crimes against humanity”, according to Human Rights Watch.Similarly, the UN says “Ethiopia was the second-worst jailer of journalists in Africa” when the TPLF was in power. The Ethiopian people fought for their freedom and finally forced the TPLF to step down in 2018.When the previous prime minister, who was really a figurehead while the TPLF held real power, resigned in February 2018, amid popular unrest, power struggle ensued within the TPLF-dominated ruling coalition. The TPLF wanted to continue its domination and nominated a surrogate, but representatives of the two largest ethnic groups within the coalition, the Amharas and Oromos, nominated Abiy Ahmed to be the leader of the coalition. He won by a large majority and was elected Prime Minister by parliament in April 2018.The TPLF, fearful that Abiy Ahmed poses a serious threat to is continued domination of Ethiopia’s polity, has opposed him ever since.Once he became Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed introduced political and economic reforms that were designed to reduce corruption, rent seeking, privileged access to resources; and to remove the strong link between the TPLF and the bureaucracy, the army, and the intelligence and security agency. He released thousands of prisoners and allowed exiled political parties to return to Ethiopia. The political reforms were intended to pave the way for a democratic transition in Ethiopia.He laid out a plan to privatize state-owned enterprises, to deregulate certain markets, and to allow foreign investment in sectors that were previously restricted to Ethiopians. Although these “homegrown” economic reforms don’t incorporate all of the policy recommendations of the IMF and the WorldBank, they were endorsed as policies that promote economic growth, improve standards of living,and reduce poverty in Ethiopia by these institutions and by extension the US government. His policy can be described as a new liberal policy. The Biden administration’s hostile attitude towards the Ethiopian government doesn’t emanate from policy differences.These reforms threatened the political and economic domination of Ethiopia by the TPLF. The TPLF controlled all sectors of Ethiopia’s economy through its conglomerate called the Endowment Fund for the Development of Tigray (EFFORT). Although it is illegal in Ethiopia for a political party to own companies, the TPLF owned and managed EFFORT, a business going concern, that it classified as an endowment entity. EFFORT, with a capital value of US $3 billion and employees of 47,000 in 2017 was by far the largest business entity inTPLF, using its dominant political position, facilitated the transfer of loans from state-owned banks, foreign exchange from the National Bank of Ethiopia, land from the state, and various assets from government ministries and agencies. It enabled EFFORT companies to buy state-owned enterprises at low prices.Employing shabby accounting tricks with the various EFFORT companies, it embezzled a significant amount of resources from the various public institutions. According to a UN report, since the TPLF came to power in Ethiopia in 1991, it embezzled US $30 billion and took it out of the country. It has also been reported that loans worth millions of dollarsextended to EFFORT companies by the state-owned Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and the Development Bank of Ethiopia were classified as “non-performing”.In other words, the loans were never paid to the banksAnother contentious issue for the TPLF is Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed signed a peace treaty with Eritrea, ending the twenty-year war between the two countries, for which he won the Nobel Peace Prize. The TPLF opposed the treaty because it felt that it should have been included in the discussion, negotiation, and signing of the agreement, although international treaties are signed by national governments, not by regional governments. Ethiopians and Eritreans were ecstatic, and the world was supportive of his domestic reforms and peace initiative with Eritrea.But the TPLF leaders, convinced that power had slipped away for good, fearful that their domination was in danger, and worried that they may face justice for the crimes they had committed while in power, chose to oppose his reformist agenda right from the outset. The Ethiopian government alleges the former head of intelligence, Getachew Assefa, a prominent member of the TPLF, organized the assassination attempt on Abiy Ahmed on June 23, 2018, just three months after Abiy Ahmed was sworn in as prime minister.Between 2018 and 2020, the TPLF took a series of obstructive, provocative, and subversive actions. It withdrew from the coalition government and retreated to Mekele, the capital of Tigray. The TPLF blocked the federal police from serving court warrants to the accused former TPLF officials inMekele. It prevented the central government from moving military equipment from Tigray to other regions of Ethiopia. It held military parades,declared Tigray a de facto state, and threatened to separate Tigray from Ethiopia.The TPLF held regional elections in Tigray in September 2020, in defiance of the Ethiopian parliament, in violation of the constitution, and claimed to have won 98% of the votes. In October 2020, the TPLF rejected the new commanders of the Northern Command, appointed by the central government to oversee the military bases located in Tigray, and issued a statementthat said, “… leadership changes and command reorganizations and the movement of troops or armaments, are unacceptable and will never be implemented.” Most importantly, the TPLF moved to overthrow the Ethiopian government through an armed insurrectionand attacked the Northern Command bases in Tigray on November 4, 2020.Once the war started, the TPLF launched rockets on Asmara, the capital of Eritrea on November 10 and 27, 2020.The Ethiopian government, supported by the Eritrean army and regional paramilitary forces, responded to the attacks decisively, removing the TPLF from power in Tigray, but facing resistance from the Tigrayan population and pressure from the US, the EU, and other Western governments, the government withdrew from Tigray in June 2021.The government says that it withdrew its army from Tigray for humanitarian reasons, while the TPLF maintains that it kicked out the army from Tigray. The TPLF regained control of Tigray and expanded the conflict beyond Tigray, with the aim of overthrowing the government, as it had originally planned.Beginning from June of this year,the TPLF has invaded the neighboring regions of Amhara and Afar, where it has destroyed schools, hospitals, churches, mosques, and killed hundreds of civilians. According to a USAID official in Addis Ababa, “in every town they have gone into, they looted the warehouses, they have looted trucks, and they have caused a great deal of destruction in all the villages they have visited.” The TPLF has burnt down homes of farmers in the AmharaAugust, the TPLF took the town of Lalibela, a World Heritage site and home to the famous 12th century rock-hewn churches. Many Ethiopians are worried that the revengeful TPLF may destroy these churches, just as al-Qaeda, ISIS, and the Taliban have done elsewhere. The TPLF has looted invaluable artifacts, relics, and treasures from these historic national monuments. It has partially destroyed one of the 3rd-century churches. A recent report by Amnesty International reveals that the TPLF has engaged in gang rapes, extensive looting, and mass killing of civilians in the Amhara and Afar regions:war crimes.The TPLF is now threatening to overrun the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, thanks to its superior organization, coupled with the incompetence, inexperience, and corruption of some of the military commanders and the civilian leadership of Ethiopia.But due to the war crimes the TPLF has committed in the areas it has invaded, the local population is fighting back the TPLF. The TPLF has overextended itself as well. The TPLF, facing stiff resistance from the population, shortages of military supplies, and war-fatigue from the people of Tigray, cannot sustain the war for long, although it may continue the conflict with sustained guerilla attacks. It is a matter of time before the TPLF is forced to withdraw from the Amhara and Afar regions, let alone enter Addis Ababa.The Biden Administration’s Plan for Regimeadministration officials, particularly those in the US State Department, are well aware of the nature of the conflict between the Ethiopian government and the TPLF. Tibor Nagy,the US Assistant Secretary for African Affairs and former US Ambassador to Ethiopiaunder the Trump administration says, “…. it seems like they [the TPLF] were doing this more to depose the prime minister from power and to reassert themselves into the prominent position that they had atop the Ethiopian political spectrum for the last 27 years…”Although the US government is fully aware of the TPLF’s dictatorial past and current political ambitions, it has decided to support the TPLF diplomatically and politically by demanding a negotiated settlement, hoping that negotiation would result in a power sharing arrangement with the TPLF. The US wants to bring about regime change in Ethiopia, to install a repressive government headed by the TPLF, but most Ethiopians adamantly oppose the return of the TPLF to power.Six months ago, the White House invited veteran Ethiopian politicians, some of whom have served time in jail for corruption, to a meeting to form a transitional government in Ethiopia. The meeting failed to achieve its objective because the politicians could not agree among themselves on the future direction of Ethiopia. Subsequently, the postponed election took place on June 23 in which the Prime Minister’s Prosperity Party won a landslide victory, firmly establishing him as the democratically elected leader of Ethiopia.The plot to replace the Abiy Ahmed government, however, continues in Washington. On November 5, nine political groups signed an agreement with TPLF in Washington to form a transitional government, most probably with the blessing, coordination, and facilitation of the White House, with much fanfare from some Western media outlets. The scheme was an orchestrated political spectacle to pressure the Ethiopian government, but it will not have significant political outcomes. The group excludes the two largest ethnic groups, the Amharas in the Oromos that account for more than 60% of Ethiopia’s population; the group has little support inside Ethiopia; and its political agenda of establishing a confederation of ethnic states is an untenable political project that most Ethiopians reject.US Pressure on the Ethiopian GovernmentNo sooner had the Biden administration taken office than it started issuing orders to the Ethiopian government. Antony Blinken on February 27, 2021 ordered the Ethiopian government to immediately remove Eritrean troops and the Amhara militia from Tigray. He reiterated the same demand on March 2, in a telephone conversation with Abiy Ahmed, according to a State Department spokesperson. Blinken also pressed the issue with the UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, on March 12 and appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he repeated the same demands.In May, he demanded that the western part of Tigray be under the administration of the provisional government in Tigray, ignoring the historical circumstances under which this region was incorporated into Tigray.In addition to issuing orders on troop withdrawal from Tigray and the keeping of Tigray’s territory unchanged, the US has also demanded that the Ethiopian government provide unfettered access to humanitarian aid for the people of Tigray, end “ethnic cleansing” in Tigray, establish an independent, international, and credible inquiry into the abuse of human rights in Tigray; unilaterally end all hostilities, pursue a negotiated settlement to the armed conflict, and include all parties in the political process. The Ethiopian government has accepted most of these demands by the Biden administration, and yet the US pressureMay 24, the US imposed travel restrictions on Ethiopian officials allegedly involved in humanitarian abuses. On September 17, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order authorizing the Treasury Department to impose economic sanctions against selected government officials, saying that Ethiopia poses a “national security” threat to the US. Ethiopia has neither the capacity nor the intention to undermine US national security either in the US or elsewhere in the world. The President’s statement that Ethiopia poses a national security threat to the US is pure fabrication to justify his administration’s actions.The Biden administration claimsto support democracy, peace, and national unity in Ethiopia. The reality is the opposite. The US government is threatening the territorial integrity and stability of Ethiopia by supporting the separatist, terrorist-designated TPLF that has vowed to dismantle the Ethiopian state, to destroy the Ethiopian army, and to break up Ethiopia. The Ethiopian people see the Biden administration’s hypocrisy and disingenuity.The White House is withholdingUS $272 million in security and development aid appropriated by Congress for Ethiopia. On November 2, Biden threatened to withdraw Ethiopia’s duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), at a time when the TPLF was claiming that it was ready to march on Addis Ababa. The removal of Ethiopia from AGOA, while inflicting considerable harm on thousands of workers, farmers, and their families, would have little impact on the Ethiopian government’s resolve to fight the TPLF.The Democratic Party and the TPLF leadershipDespite the State Department’s familiarity with the TPLF’s history and its motivation in instigating, prolonging, and escalating the armed conflict, why has the Biden administration taken a strong stand against the Ethiopian government? Three major factors explain the Biden administration’s belligerent attitude towards the Ethiopian government: the historical alliance between the US and the TPLF, the Biden administration’s desire to project to the world that the US as “a shining city on the hill”, and the Abiy’ government’s refusal to obey US orders.The US has had a close relationship with the TPLF, especially with the Democratic Party, since the late 1980s when the TPLF was engaged in guerilla warfare against the military government in Ethiopia. The US played a key role in imposing the TPLF on the Ethiopian people in 1991. Once the TPLF came to power, the alliance between the TPLF and the US, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, flourished, despite the TPLF’s egregious violations of human rights in Ethiopia.The TPLF-controlled government received billions of dollars in US foreign aid.President Obama declared that the 2015 election was democratic, an election in which the coalition of ethnic parties controlled by the TPLF won 100% of the parliamentary seats. In return for US diplomatic, economic, and political support the TPLF, the TPLF became an obedient executor of US foreign policy in Eritrea, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and other African countries. The TPLF was a reliable, subservient, subordinate “partner” for the US.A contributing factor to the Biden administration’s anti-democratic position on Ethiopia is that some Obama officials who have supported the TPLF leaders in the past are currently working for the Biden administration. These officials include Susan Rice, the Director of the White House Domestic Policy Council; Wendy Sherman, the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs; and Gayle Smith, the former USAID administrator, currently responsible for distributing COVID-19 vaccinesMeles Zenawi, the late autocrat of Ethiopia, died in 2012, Susan Rice praised him as a brilliant leader and “the father of modern Ethiopia” in her eulogy. Most Ethiopians would disagree with her characterization. In 2015, Wendy Sherman declared that “Ethiopia is a democracy,” even though Ethiopia had a brutal dictatorial regime that exiled, imprisoned, tortured, and killed its political opponents, as well as journalists, professors, civil society leaders, and demonstrators. Rice and Sherman did not appear to be too concerned about human rights violations in Ethiopia when the TPLF was in power, other than occasionally making perfunctory remarks about the respect for human rights. Gayle Smith has provided material, diplomatic, and moral support to the TPLF since the early 1980s.It is reasonable to assume these former Obama administration officials, with their well-disposed stance towards the TPLF leadership, have influenced the Biden administration’s stand on the conflict in Tigray. The TPLF has friends in high places in the Biden administration and their influence is significant in both policy formation and media coverage about Ethiopia.Foreign Aid as LeverageEthiopia, one of the least developed and highly foreign-aid dependent countries, is vulnerable to economic, diplomatic, and political pressure from aid donors. Ethiopia receives the second highest amount of US foreign aid in Africa, next to Egypt, in absolute terms.On a per capita basis, Ethiopia receives less aid than many countries in Africa. In 2019, Ethiopia received US $923 million from the US, most of which was humanitarian aid. Ethiopia also obtains substantial aid from the EU, the United Kingdom, and other Western countries. Ethiopia has also borrowed extensively from the IMF, the World Bank, and private Western financial institutions.Further, Ethiopia relies heavily on foreign aid for its budget, rendering it highly susceptible to pressure from aid donors like the US. About one-third of Ethiopia’s budget is financed by foreign aid. Ethiopia’s vulnerability is considerable, and it is this leverage that the Biden administration has exploited to pressure, undermine, and threaten the democratically elected government of Ethiopia.There is also Samantha Power, the current Administrator of USAID who is a member of the US National Security Council. Just as she advocated the bombing of Libya, Syria, and Yugoslavia in the name of “defending human rights”,she is now threatening Ethiopia by saying “all options are on the table” unless Ethiopia negotiates with the TPLF. She has condemned the Ethiopian government vociferously for violations of human rights and “ethnic cleansing” in Tigray on numerous occasions while remaining silent about the war crimes committed by the TPLF in the Amhara and Afar regions. War crimes are intolerable by any party; selective allegations of human rights abuses are the ultimate hypocrisy.Behind the Biden administration’s supposed worries about human rights lies Abiy Ahmed’s refusal to obey US imperial orders on three important issues of concern for the US administration: accepting Egypt’s demands regarding the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) that Ethiopia is building on the Blue Nile, reducing Ethiopia’s strong economic ties with China, and sharing power with theand Ethiopia have a dispute over the GERD, which, when completed will be the largest dam in Africa. Egypt is primarily concerned about how the GERD and Ethiopia’s plan for its water resource development in the Nile basin would affect Egypt’s access to the waters of the Blue Nile. Egypt has demanded that Ethiopia guarantee water supply, especially during extended drought periods, and that Ethiopia sign a binding agreement not to undertake any type of water resource development that would reduce the flow of water to Egypt from the Blue Nile. The Ethiopian government maintains that it understands these concerns and is willing to discuss, but will not allow a foreign government to dictate its national policy on water management and economic development.Negotiations are underway, but the US government, starting with the Trump Administration, has supported Egypt’s position, and insists that Ethiopia accommodate Egypt’s demands. The US considers Egypt a strategically important ally in the Middle East. Ethiopia has rejected the US demand to accommodate Egypt’s request since the demand undermines Ethiopia’s economic development. Ethiopia has become a pawn in the U.S. administration’s Middle Eastern policy.China’s Rising InfluenceAs is well known, the Biden administration is concerned about the rise of China as a rival superpower and its influence in Africa, including in Ethiopia. Since the 2000s, China has been active in building infrastructure in Ethiopia, as it has done elsewhere in Africa.Ethiopia is one of the countries that is participating in China’s Belt and Road Initiative in which China has financed and developed an extensive network of railways and highways in Ethiopia.Beginning from the early 2000s, China has become more influential economically in Ethiopia than the US. China is now the largest importer of Ethiopia’s goods and services, while the US is third. China accounts for 60% of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia. Between 2000 and 2018 China lent Ethiopia $US 13.7 billion and the US,$US 9.2 billion.Most of China’s loans to Ethiopia have been allocated to infrastructure development while U.S. loans have been allocated mostly to the health and educational sectors .China’s involvement in Ethiopia is more visible to the Ethiopian public than that of America’s. Chinese investment in Ethiopia is much higher than US investment; there are many more Chinese businesspeople, engineers, investors, and even ordinary workers who are involved in the economic transformation of Ethiopia than Americans. China’s extensive influence in Ethiopia has worried the Biden administration.In a futile attempt to reduce China’s growing influence in Ethiopia and the rest of the African continent, the U S has demanded that the Ethiopian government reduce its economic ties with China, according to an Ethiopian government official. Considering China’s rising economic, military, and political power in the world, the Ethiopian government is justified in rejecting the US demand that Ethiopia reduce its economic ties with China. To obtain the most benefit from the two major economic powers, Ethiopia, like most of the African countries, would like to maintain a good relationship with both the US and China. It is not in the best interest of Ethiopia to reduce its economic ties with China or to become more dependent on the US, but the attempt by the Biden administration to undermine the Abiy government has in fact pushed Ethiopia even closer to China than everBiden administration insists that the Ethiopian government negotiate with the TPLF on an equal basis, but the Ethiopian government contends that it cannot negotiate with a terrorist organization that is engaged in the violent overthrow of the democratically elected government and is committed to the destruction of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian government maintains that it is within its sovereign right to decide with which political party it can negotiate; the US has no business in insisting that the Ethiopian government negotiate with the TPLF, any more than China has the right to tell the US government that it should negotiate with the Proud Boy.Human Rights Violation as a PretextThe refusal of the Ethiopian government to heed US demands has angered the Biden Administration. Its diplomatic maneuvers in Africa, the EU, the UN, and among its allies; its punitive measures, and its incessant threats against the Ethiopian government is nothing but retaliation for disobedience and has little to do with human rights violations in Ethiopia.The US has been conspicuously silent about the war crimes of the TPLF. If indeed the Biden administration were genuinely concerned about human rights violations in Ethiopia, it would have condemned the TPLF’s war crimes in the Amhara and Afar regions, but the US is tolerating TPLF human right abuses as it has always tolerated abuses by its allies in developing countries. Its silence has led many Ethiopians to conclude that the US is ethnically biased and that its selective condemnation of human rights violations in Ethiopia rings hollow and exposes its real motivation: punishment for disobedience.Some US commentators and politicians have suggested that the US send peacekeepers to Tigray or establisha no fly zone in Ethiopia. James Stavridis, a retired U S Admiral and former supreme allied commander of NATO, wrote an opinion piece advocating US military intervention in Ethiopia. It is most unlikely that the US will intervene militarily in Ethiopia, but until the military confrontation with the TPLF is over, the US seems resolute in pressuring the Ethiopian government.Just as the US destabilized Libya by its military intervention and by supporting Saudi Arabia’s military adventure in Yemen, the Biden administrations appears determined to destabilize Ethiopia by backing the TPLF, regardless of the adverse consequences of its misguided policy for Ethiopia, for the Horn of Africa, and even for US long-term strategic interest in the region. It seems that the Biden administration hasn’t learned from US misadventures in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria, and seems ready to repeat the same mistake in Ethiopia.By supporting the TPLF, the Biden administration has alienated the majority of the Ethiopian people, both in Ethiopia and in the diaspora.In Ethiopia, the favourable public opinion towards the US is the lowest it has ever been, but by contrast support for China has reached its highest level, primarily because of China’s refusal to impose economic and military sanctions on Ethiopia by the UN Security Council, as proposed by the US and its allies.Ethio-Americans are upset with the Biden administration and have abandoned the Democratic Party in droves; many have decided to vote for the Republican Party for the first time. The Ethiopian diaspora in the US, albeit numerically small, can be politically crucial.In the states where Biden won by a narrow margin such as in Georgia, Michigan, and Nevada, Ethiopian immigrants could play a decisive role in whether the Democratic Party retains its majority in the House and in the Senate in the 2022 mid-term elections. As the recent victory of the Republican candidate in the gubernatorial race in Virginia indicated, many Ethio-Americans switched their support to the Republican Party. That should be a clear warning for the Democratic Party.The US government should realize that the Ethiopian people will not allow the TPLF to come to power again, on its own or as a member of a transitional government. The US should note that the millions of people are currently demonstrating against the TPLF throughout Ethiopia. The US attempt to impose the TPLF on the people of Ethiopia once again, in one form or another, is an anti-democratic fruitless exercise. US support for the TPLF can only prolong the destruction, the bloodshed, and the suffering of innocent Ethiopians while damaging the international reputation of the US as a defender of democracy. The sooner the US realizes this fact, the better it is for all concerned. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/12/opinion-the-long-history-of-the-olympic-industry-and-totalitarian-regimes/,Opinion – The Long History of the Olympic Industry and Totalitarian Regimes,Mac Ross and Helen Jefferson Lenskyj,Nov 12 2021,"In recent days, protestors have risen up in defiance of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and Chinese Communist Part (CCP), demanding that the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics be removed from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on humanitarian grounds. Their rally cry is now well known. Over a million Turkic Muslims have been rounded up and sent to re-education camps, where they are forced to endure classes in language, cultural, and politics. Reports of rape and torture these camps are now making headlines. According to Freedom House, Tibet remains the least free place in the world, with religion, politics, and traditional ways of life all under relentless CCP attack. At least 157 monks and nuns have self-immolated since 2009 in hopes of illustrating the seriousness of their suffering. On the PRC’s other border, Southern Mongolians are facing forced assimilation through the elimination of their language in schools and the relocation of hundreds of thousands of traditional herdsmen to urban settings. Each region – Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia – has seen the state sanctioned settlement of thousands of Han Chinese, in what can only be regarded as settler-colonialism, alive and well in the twenty-first century. In Hong Kong, the CCP has laid siege to the “One Country, Two Systems” ideal, pushing through a National Security Law, replacing the freedoms of speech and assembly with speedy trials and convictions for peaceful protestors, who can now also be extradited to the PRC.Although not all of the CCP’s human rights violations were in full swing when the IOC awarded Beijing the 2022 Games, international observers representing groups such as Amnesty International and Freedom House had already vocally denounced the human rights disaster that was the Beijing 2008 Olympics and noted the leverage that the mega event gave the CCP to brutally crack down on Tibet. That the CCP is now using the 2022 Olympics to sport wash their human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Hong Kong, is now obvious. The mega event is now a part of their oppressive machine, replicated with the sanction of the IOC and all nations who refuse to boycott. But we’ve been here before. We know the dangers of awarding the Olympics to authoritarian regimes. The blood of the victims soaks the earth from Berlin to Mexico City, Seoul to Sochi. Yet here we are. Again.Contemporary sport studies and political science literature uses the term “sport washing” to describe how authoritarian regimes use mega events to distract attention away from their human rights abuses. The IOC has been a willing partner in these efforts, clinging to its fictional “apolitical” stance to ignore the slaughter of citizens in host nations, as well as the suffering of millions more. This is not hyperbole.In 1936, despite public outcry in the USA, Canada, and beyond, the IOC rolled into Nazi Germany to support the grandest example of sport washing the world has ever seen. Although there was already abundant evidence of state sanctioned anti-Semitism, Adolf Hitler made the stance of the Nazi Party crystal clear via the Nuremberg Laws in 1935. As historians Richard Menkis and Harold Troper explain in their book More than Just Games: Canada and the 1936 Olympics, the new legislation denied “Jews any and all protections of the German state, including citizenship, and gave legal sanction to the total excision of Jews from German society.” The new laws had little impact on the IOC. In fact, IOC member Charles H. Sherrill was not only on hand in Nuremberg, he was also impressed by the spectacle and pageantry of it all. US Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage fully supported Hitler, while opposing American calls for a boycott. Later, the Olympic Games had a similar effect on the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC), illustrating the event’s power to sport wash heinous, racist Nazi policies with the momentary glamour of the Games. “And so what was surely one of the greatest sports festivals of all times came to an end,” reflected the COC, “having made its magnificent contribution toward a fitter youth and more peaceful international relationships.” Three years later Hitler instigated World War II, during which roughly 60 million people lost their lives. So much for “peaceful international relationships.”Just over thirty years later, it was clear the IOC had learned little from the debacle in Berlin. Following founder De Coubertin’s goal of ‘sportifying’ the globe in line with the Olympic faster/higher/stronger principle, the IOC eagerly awarded the 1968 Olympic Games to Mexico City, under the control of the nation’s single-party, authoritarian government. When student protestors rose up, opposing the notion of hosting an Olympics while so many Mexicans struggled to feed and house their families, the authorities sent in the Olympia Battalion – raised specifically for the Games – to massacre hundreds of protestors. The IOC did not question the incident, accepting the party-line from Mexican officials.Brundage, now IOC president, wanted the games to go on uninterrupted, but the IOC, keeping up appearances as usual, decided on a one-day interval before resuming theforward to 1981 and we find the IOC awarding the 1988 Olympic Games to tyrant Chun Doo-hwan. Much like the CCP today, the Chun government arrested citizens and sent them to re-education camps without any due process, resulting in the imprisonment of at least 60,000 people in the months leading up to Seoul’s successful bid alone. Before the end of 1980, Chun would lead a military assault on protestors in Gwangju, massacring his citizenry for two days, resulting in 4,900 deaths. Emboldened by Seoul’s victorious Olympic bid, Chun increasingly cracked down on dissenters. The camps continued, becoming sites of not only political re-education, but rape, torture, and murder. To make way for the Olympics, authorities displaced 750,000 people from their homes, representing the most Olympic-related displacements other than Beijing 2008.When Sochi came knocking, with its unlimited money and authoritarian management, the IOC salivated over the excess and grandeur Vladimir Putin could lend to the Olympic Movement. Putin’s legal assault on LGBTQ+ rights drew the ire of protesters worldwide and should have been enough for the IOC to move the Games. But the money. The power. It was all too much for the IOC to pass up. The bulldozing of homes, and displacement of 2,000 people, largely flew under the radar. There were voices within Russia who opposed the Games and Putin. In a 2013 interview with Real Sports with Bryant Gumble, Boris Nemtsov called Sochi 2014 “a festival of corruption and mismanagement.” He continued: “We have 20 million poor people in this country. We have a problem in police. We have a problem in our hospitals. Putin spent $50 billion for what? For what?” He was assassinated in 2015.What make the 2022 Beijing Olympics so utterly indefensible is that we’ve been here before. Not even two full decades have passed since the last PRC-IOC festival of human rights violations, yet the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) of the world are lining up to participate. Back in 2008, IOC President Jacques Rogge claimed the Olympics would improve the human rights situation in the PRC. The opposite happened. In fact, things are now so bad that current IOC President Thomas Bach won’t utter a word about the state of human rights in the PRC. It’s game over. The Olympic ideal of peaceful internationalism has always belonged in the realm of mythology. There is no dearth of evidence to show that these so-called ideals are dead and buried beneath the capitalist excesses of the IOC and the authoritarian regimes of recent host countries. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/12/opinion-black-and-southern-feminisms-matter-in-the-global-climate-struggle/,Opinion – Black and Southern Feminisms Matter in the Global Climate Struggle,Lydia Ayame Hiraide,Nov 12 2021,"Black people, indigenous people, and people of colour, and particularly women, have often been cropped out of popular mainstream narratives and discourses about climate and environmental issues (sometimes literally). Despite attempts at erasure and exclusion from environmental narratives, these women have long been at the vanguard of environmental struggle – one that manifests within and across national borders. They create and animate radical ecological principles that resonate with the core commitments of radical Black and Southern feminisms. So, what happens if we foreground environmental action undertaken by these women both within and across national borders? What do their praxes tell us about our collective framing of and potential approaches to climate and environmental issues in what has often been referred to as the ‘decisive decade’ on a heating planet?Neither Black nor Southern feminisms are monolithic. These are sticky terms as they also constitute spaces of contention within themselves, and, in many ways, are also not discrete categories distinct from each other. Nonetheless, we can loosely describe them in the following ways: the notion of Black feminisms typically refers to the long tradition of feminist struggle against the intersecting oppressions of race and gender, particularly, although not exclusively, as animated by enslaved African American women and their descendants. Crucially, Black feminisms put ‘the perspectives and experiences of African American women at the center rather than in their historically marginal position.’ They offer intersectionality as a (not uncontested) way of articulating the complex ways in which ostensibly discrete technologies of domination such as race, gender, class, can overlap to produce subaltern groups. In a parallel move to centre marginality, Southern feminisms materialise from the ‘Global South’ – a political concept which describes the ‘spaces and peoples negatively impacted by contemporary capitalist globalization.’ Southern feminisms are therefore not bound to one location. Rather, they are characterised by their critique of the ‘capitalist-patriarchal-modern-colonial order.’ To this end, Southern feminisms also encompass the Black feminisms that emerge from locations such as the space which we refer to as North America, for Black feminists also engage in this critique (although, arguably sometimes with less attention to the global problematics of the histories and reverberations of European colonialism). Moreover, as Anne Garland Mahler reminds us, there can be ‘economic Souths in the geographic North.’In the context of climate and environmental crisis, Black and Southern feminisms harness their critical approaches to point to the social, historical, and political stakes of environmental matters. They steer away from ‘green’ solutions which serve to reinscribe and perpetuate existing relations of widespread inequality and extractive domination. This is essential because how we frame a problem ultimately determines how we solve it.Burdens unequally sharedThe burdens of climate change and environmental breakdown are disproportionately placed on the shoulders of the poorest across the Global South, and especially Africa. The top ten countries with the lowest CO2 emissions per capita are all African nations. And yet, these countries also mark the places in which food security is being threatened by droughts and extreme weather events to the greatest extent. In an astonishing example, the country with the highest levels of food insecurity in the world is Burundi – which is also the lowest emitter of carbon emissions in the world. In fact, Burundi’s carbon dioxide emissions per capita is so low that the figure is often rounded to zero. This contradiction forms the key contention of climate justice activists, who frame climate change as a global social issue wherein ‘those most responsible for climate change are relatively insulated from its impacts, [whilst] those least responsible are stripped of basic freedoms and dignity.’ These global imbalances of climate change thus run along what W.E.B. Du Bois referred to as the ‘global colour line,’ whereby the constructed ‘differences of race – which show themselves chiefly in the color of the skin and the texture of the hair… [are] made the basis of denying to over half the world the right of sharing to their utmost ability the opportunities and privileges of modern civilization.’ Black and Southern feminists show us that this global colour line is also a gendered colour line, as women and girls bear the brunt of one of the defining challenges of our century – climate change and environmentalwomen, indigenous women, and women of colour will be, and already have been, hardest hit by the effects of ecological crisis worldwide. Women already constitute the majority of the world’s poor. We know that poverty is a significant barrier to climate resilience and/or mitigation. The majority of people displaced by climate change are women. Women are 14 times more likely to die than men in extreme weather events for various reasons. These range from the dangerous conditions in which they often work to the responsibilities they hold for the safety of children. If they survive, they are more likely to experience increased violence at the hands of men afterwards. As temperatures rise and water scarcity increases, girls who should be in school are forced to miss out on their education as they are required to walk further and further to fulfil their responsibilities as the primary fetchers of water for their households. When livelihoods are threatened by drying lands and failing crops, these girls are also more likely to be married off at increasingly younger ages. Climate change has thus been described as a ‘threat multiplier,’ not least by UN representatives themselves. Rosemary DiCarlo, the UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs has noted that the ‘relationship between climate-related risks and conflict is complex and often intersects with political, social, economic and demographic factors.’Climate change and environmental breakdown do indeed function as ‘threat multipliers,’ aggravating the material manifestations of a global gendered colour line. Black and Southern feminists go further, however, to illustrate that climate change and environmental breakdown not only worsen existing relations of domination, but they are also rooted in the social, political, and economic processes that produced the inequalities that ecological degradation is said to exacerbate. Hence, Black and Southern feminisms seek not only to combat climate and environmental breakdown, but to explain them. Importantly, this explanation does not rely on the exclusive use of a solely scientific or technocratic vocabulary that extracts ecological crises from their historical and political contexts. It explicitly engages with the politics of racialised economies, gendered violence, and complex geographies of domination to trace the climate and environmental crisis in ways that the exclusive, affectless invocation of global heating in degrees Celsius cannot.Instead, Black and Southern analyses allow us to make bolder claims than that of climate change being a ‘threat multiplier.’ They excavate a dirty pipeline from Europe’s first violent encounters with the world beyond its borders to the urgent crisis of ecological breakdown that we face today. Moreover, this historically embedded approach actively rejects a naturalisation of the Global South as impoverished by nature or mere coincidence. Rather, it recognises past and current imbalances of power among and within economies and moves the conversation towards addressing the needs and concerns of those being hit first and worst by climate and environmental breakdown (a category which frequently, and not innocently, coincides with historically marginalised populations). In a word, Black and Southern feminists make a strong case for a ‘just transition’ – ‘moving to a more sustainable economy in a way that’s fair toscholars have warned against imposing narratives which speak over people negatively affected by climate change, particularly narratives of passive victimhood. Speaking in another context, Chandra Mohanty cautions against participating in a discursive colonialism which creates for itself unidimensional visions of the ‘third world woman,’ who exists as part of a flattened homogenous group. Certainly, we must not minimise the burdens which Black women, indigenous women, and women of colour are forced to carry on a planet where temperatures, sea levels, and the violent chasm between rich and poor are increasing. But we must turn away from narratives of passive victimhood which enact this discursive colonialism by actively recognising and remembering that these women have long been at the frontlines of environmental struggle across the world, as Black and Southern feminists themselves demand. They have always married the rights of oppressed peoples to that of the land, air, and water which nourish and house us. We see this in examples such as the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, the Chipko movement in India, the environmental justice movement in what we refer to as the USA, and the Independent Lenca Indigenous Movement of La Paz in Honduras. Today, we continue to witness a growing dynamic global movement spearheaded by young people like Vanessa Nakate, Mikaela Loach, and Xiye Bastida, who are fully broaching the radical notion of global climate justice. They, like their forbears, urge us to consider the climate and environmental crisis in the context of global and local social inequalities which are bound up in histories of global conquest, domination, and extractive economies.Black and Southern feminist praxes therefore expose the ways in which the same processes that drive ecological degradation also drive social, political, and economic oppression; they trace ecological crisis through violent histories and contemporary legacies of European empire. Within the increasingly crowded platform of green advocacy, Black and Southern feminists disrupt hegemonic environmentalisms which fail to make these connections. We can understand their positions as part of a longer tradition of anti-colonial movements, which have always placed the rights of people, land, air, and water at the heart of their fights.Ultimately, Black and Southern feminists challenge us to consider the climate and environmental crisis as a crisis tied up in global histories of race, gender, and class as embedded in European empire. They urge us to consider how these histories continue to manifest, forcing us to reflect on how we perpetuate relations of domination amongst both humans and all other life on earth. By setting up the parameters of the conversation in this way, they delineate the possibilities of change – because identifying exploitative and extractive economies which are organised along the lines of race, class, and gender as a central part of the problem means ruling them out as possible solutions.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/07/opinion-uzbekistan-at-a-political-crossroads/,Opinion – Uzbekistan at A Political Crossroads?,Martin Duffy,Nov 7 2021,"Kremlin.ruAs we psephologists are fond of saying, the October 2021 Uzbekistan votes are in with President Shavkat Mirziyoyev winning over 80% of the votes. The result, putting the matter bluntly, is that nothing much has changed. The OSCE point to “lack of genuine electoral competition in this election. Independent opposition parties were excluded from the registration process contrary to international standards and OSCE commitment (and) there were reported cases of intimidation”. It is apparent that the process of democratization in Uzbekistan has far to go if elections aim to achieve full legitimacy. There was no genuine pluralism or meaningful engagement between candidates or with citizens. And, as Reinhold Lopatka noted, there was substantial adding to voter lists, ballot box stuffing in multiple polling stations and widespread flaws in counting procedures.“The recent and ongoing reforms are an encouraging sign,” said Heidi Hautala, Head of the EP delegation. “But the exclusion of opposition parties and the lack of genuine competition, as well as the high number of irregularities we saw on election day, remain substantial obstacles in the path of the democratization process”. Daniela De Ridder, Head of the OSCE PA delegation noted “the continuance of negative practices observed in past decades” (OCSE).As for regime performance, preliminary results published by the CEC have shown incumbent President Shavkat Mirziyoyev winning a second term with a majority 80.1%, although faring the worst performance for an incumbent in terms of vote share since 1991. As polls closed at 8pm on 24th October 2021 the Uzbekistan Central Election Commission were able to report that voter turnout at the country’s presidential elections had exceeded 80%. In the early presidential elections in 2016, the voter turnout had been 87.83%. Five candidates, including incumbent President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, had vied for the presidential office but to all intents it was always a one-man race. Mirziyoyev faced no genuine opposition and victory will let him extend his reform campaign and improve foreign trade and investment – while still protecting Miziyoye’s centralized power.No genuine opposition parties were registered and while there was some relaxation on social media, criticism of the President is all but constitutionally forbidden. So, the four candidates running against Mirziyoyev were nominated by parties which support the president.Mirziyoyev pledged to cut poverty through rapid economic growth and gradually decentralize decisionmaking by devolving power to district councils. In the extremely limited monitoring of public opinion discernible even in urban areas, the President was able to mobilize his party faithful, and from such opinion polls as were conducted he had retained lukewarm support even among younger voters. Press and civic observers certainly voiced in favor of state measures against financial hardship. This was a slogan the President could easily exploit, but it now remains to be seen if it can be delivered. Perhaps it simply does not matter as Uzbekistan emerges from this election no more pluralistic than it had enteredobservers will be hesitant to see this as a mere “sham election” but at the least it is an election without genuine candidacy. It is, more accurately, an act of political acclimation orchestrated by president and party. It also raises questions over Uzbekistan’s so-called new era of ‘openness’ which had been trumpeted in front of American and European audiences.Regrettably, on this election day, as those before it, Uzbekistan remains one of the most repressive regimes in the world. This election answers unequivocally the hopeful narrative of some western observers that perceptibly Uzbekistan could be getting more democratic. The Central Asian nation, infamous for systematic human rights abuses may have rebadged itself “New Uzbekistan – new elections” but there is barely a shred of evidence that anything has genuinely changed. Uzbekistan has improved its relations with neighboring states, some of which were previously considered “sworn enemies” and its citizens could travel, with a visa-free regime serving more than 50 countries. Symbolically the old security boss of Karimov’s regime was made redundant and high-profile political releases included Muhammad Bekjan, one of the world’s longest-imprisoned journalists. It is also true that a lighter touch has been taken to press freedoms with independent media, including the BBC and Voice of America having fresh accreditation. However, there is little to support the President’s assertion before the election that nobody can put pressure on civil society and mass media.As in 2019, the 2021 race further demonstrates that the core of the political system in Uzbekistan remains the same – no oppositional parties are allowed to run. All five parties participating in the election are loyal to president and regime. The oppositional Erk party and its exiled leader Muhammad Solih remain banned in Uzbekistan. One must concede that pre-election media and results coverage gave a veneer of live TV debates, the president and his family remained untouchable.Prior to these elections the UN Committee against Torture expressed concerns over continued use of torture by law enforcement and prison officials. UN rights expert Diego Garcia-Sayan concluded following his visit to Uzbekistan that “substantial threats against judicial independence and the rule of law remain”. Human Rights Watch retained it classification of “authoritarian country”despite some tokenistic releasing of political prisoners.That no genuine Uzbek grass-root organization observed the voting process on Sunday shows that the government is still wary of civil society. On Karimov’s death Uzbekistan was so repressive it was endangered by protest. Mirziyoyev could only rescue legitimacy by some limited change. Even in authoritarian states, presidents require some measure of public approval and support, and the election suggests again that this pseudo-liberalism might have paid off.Freedom of speech has certainly been on the line in ‘New Uzbekistan’. The tightening of control on new media outlets and bloggers in the immediate pre-election period demonstrates Mirziyoyev’s scant commitment to freedom (RFERL.org) The OSCE interim report noted “an increased possibility to critically report on some social and political issues…many longstanding issues remain, including intimidation and harassment of journalists and bloggers, and a restrictive legal framework for the media”. The Associated Press were still more blunt, “Uzbekistan has never held an election that was deemed fair or democratic by Western observers”.Uzbekistan has fascinated me since my college years when I dreamt of a train journey across Tashkent, Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva. As an international election observer, I have now happily made these journeys several times and the country remains as enchanting as ever. Regrettably, the same might have to be concluded about its stubborn authoritarianism. The changes steamrollered through by President Shavkat Mirziyoyev might have signaled economic but not political change. Proclaimed in 2017, Mirziyoyev’s Development Strategy for 2017–2021, promised to modernize and liberalize the Uzbek state and society. According to state propaganda, a new Uzbekistan awaits. The reality of the situation is that Mirziyoyev has pushed a development but hardly a genuine human rightsis (however) also a danger that over-insistence from the west could threaten the progress made so far in Uzbekistan’s slow journey towards democracy. The western agenda with its espousal of judicial reforms, press freedoms, support of sexual minorities and gay marriages may prove to be too much, too soon unless Mirziyoyev can bring his powerbrokers with him. Uzbekistan today seems split between international aspirations and a conservatism which remains deeply embedded in the Uzbek mentality. Putting it crudely, Uzbekistan’s path for liberalization is dependent on Mirziyoyev ‘s direction while the outside soft power methods will have effect only when the local people are still given enough freedom to redesign the country’s moral compass.The road to Uzbek democracy is paved with broken promises. Under Mirziyoyev, Uzbekistan’s political system has continued to be tightly controlled. While a variety of parties ran in the 2019–20 parliamentary election, all of them were loyal to the government. In May 2020, the state announced reforms to ‘liberalize’ its media and electoral laws. In November 2020, a delegation led by Uzbek Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov visited the US looking to strengthen its strategic relationship. The meetings resulted in US$100 million being given to Uzbekistan for economic assistance, and the US pledging Uzbekistan’s UN Human Rights Council bid. Some reforms had been implemented and Parliamentary sessions were more often accessible to the public. However, MPs continued to vote unanimously on issues like the appointment of provincial governors, without attempts at debate or pluralistic decision-making.In the atrophied state of Uzbekistan politics, how the future state handles opposition will be noted by observers and by Uzbek civic groups, many of whom have been accused of acting as Mirziyoyev stooges. In some respects, he has shown himself to be a shrewd manipulator of the political system, more adroit than any of his cold-war predecessors. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/04/opinion-are-peacemakers-really-blessed/,Opinion – Are Peacemakers Really Blessed?,Mukesh Kapila,Nov 4 2021,"A recent listing identified 27 active armed conflicts worldwide , of which six are inter-state or territorial disputes, three are transnational terrorism,and the rest various forms of civil wars and domestic unrest.In past days, a 28thjoined the list: resurgent instability in Sudan following a military coup. This is just the tip of the iceberg of conflicts. For every country embroiled in violence, there are several others inciting or arming one side or other – or profiting in myriad ways. Such conflicts display the properties of an ‘infectious’ disease. They spill out to infect neighbours and then go geopolitical, akin to a ‘pandemic’. Palestine is a familiar example. The impact is like a ‘chronic’ ailment (think Syria), or indeed transmitted inter-generationally like a ‘bad gene’ (think Afghanistan).With no vaccine against war, world doctors – United Nations and regional organisations such as the African Union – prescribe their favoured elixir. This is a cocktail of condemnations, exhortations, sanctions, and dribbles of humanitarian aid (Ethiopia/Tigray/Eritrea). Over time, the medicine loses potency (Iran) and needs something stronger – known as ‘peace-keeping’ (Mali). This remedy may help temporarily (Darfur) but make matters worse in the longer-term (DRC). When all else is failing, it is time for the healer-magician to come in. With a grand title such as ‘Special Envoy’ or High Representative’, their job is to negotiate or mediate peace. This is big business nowadays with scores appointed by the UN, AU, European Union,ASEAN and other regional bodies, or governments.The mediator seeks to create an enabling environment for the warring parties to, first, defuse their quarrel by reducing and suspending hostilities; second, clarify the disputed issues; third, agree the framework or rules to bridge differences; fourth, to build mutual confidence by talking less horribly to each other and allowing humanitarian succour; and finally, most important, helping the parties to honour their agreements. A ‘peace dividend’ is promised to flow thereafter. Unfortunately, this is usually short-changed, and the disillusioned protagonists resume conflict. A peace imposed from outside (South Sudan) or temporarily rented with fake promises (Haiti), usually unravels.Thus, the reality is that peace negotiations are messy. Not least because conflicts have to be ripe for solving. This only happens when one side has almost won (India/East Pakistan-Bangladesh) or both sides have battered themselves to stalemate (Yemen). Otherwise, mediation freezes – not solves – the conflict (Bosnia).The quality of peace that comes is closely correlated to the brutality with which the preceding war was conducted. This is associated with debate on the trade-off between justice and peace: which comes first? Also, thorny is the issue of compensation for victims and reparation from aggressors. Often, the negotiators don’t strike the right balance and conflicts rumble on (Mexico), despite paper peace agreementsmediator can ever claim victory because all peace agreements are fragile, and all peace is provisional. That is because there are always those who throw spanners in the peace works because constant conflict suits them (Lebanon). Or they make hay at home while fomenting proxy wars elsewhere (Cold War Mozambique). Such spoilers make the job of mediators tricky, especially if the external cheerleaders or conflict sponsors are powerful actors in their own right (Iraq).Mediators also need their own sponsors. They are friendly governments and institutions, who give discreet advice and criticism to keep you honest and focussed. This is vital because the chances of distraction and derailment are very high. Called by designations such as “Friends of…” and “Contact Group for …”, they add muscle and money to a mediator because peace processes are expensive and require much lubrication.I discovered from my (successful) experience of negotiating humanitarian access between the Sudanese and the-then rebels in the South that mediation may require drinking much beer in the cause of peace, as well as exchanging suitably shiny gifts, and enduring lengthy stays in luxury hotels. As I also learnt (Sierra Leone), other inducements may be needed. For example, a generous life-long stipend at a Western university as distinguished scholar in flower-arranging, if it helps the peaceful exit of a stubborn dictator.Mediators are obviously noble versions of our normal quarrelsome selves. Aspiring mediators can also attend courses, read books and follow handbooks. I have never come across an effective mediator who did that, though they can have lucrative lecturing careers. I got vital practical tips from them.Working alongside General Sumbeiywo on Southern Sudan peace, I learnt that a mediator who gets amidst a quarrel of ‘brothers’ will have a short life. In Afghanistan, as special adviser to UN Special Representative, Lakhdar Brahimi,I learnt that patience andpersistence are indispensable. Also giving mind-numbing attention to everyone’s grumbles is crucial.With Sergio Vieira de Mello in Kosovo and East Timor, I understood that charm was a powerful tool to get recalcitrants on board, but had to be deployed with creativity. Tragically, Al-Quaeda were immune to charm and assassinated him in Baghdad.That mediation has its limits was a lesson that I also learnt painfully as UN chief in Sudan when the Darfur genocide happened on my watch. Having personally witnessed previous genocidal conflicts in Rwanda and Srebrenica/Bosnia, I absorbed history’s lesson that force is ultimately necessary to stop genocides (Nazi Germany). We are now observing the same in Tigray/Ethiopia. Visiting post-genocide Cambodia as special adviser to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I understood that for societies that have once tasted this special evil, peace-making is a permanent mission: lest we forget, lest we repeat.“Blessed are the peace-makers” says the Christian Bible. Islam, Hinduism, and other faiths have comparable beliefs. But do they deserve Nobel Peace Prizes? While Martin Luther King Jr. did, the premature awards to Henry Kissinger (Vietnam), Aung San Suu Kyi (Rohingya/Myanmar) and Abiy Ahmed (Ethiopia/Tigray) indicate that ‘God’ and the Nobel Committee don’t always keep the same standards.Mediators should be neutral and impartial so that their ‘good offices’ are trusted by all sides. But they must also be astute politicians; that is where principle and pragmatism collide.Possibly, the shady dealings of South African ex-President Thabo Mbeki as African Union mediator on Darfur actually delayed resolution until street mobs got rid of the genocide-indicted Sudanese dictator Al-Bashir. A taint also attaches to Olusegun Obasanjo, AU envoy for the Ethiopia/Tigray crisis. Once, Nigeria’s strongman President he is said to be a pious, reformed man. Who makes for better real-world negotiators? The pure saintly types, or those with experience of sinning?is said that “since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed.” Finding the key to unlock the minds of human beings remains the perennial challenge for mediators.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/02/opinion-scotland-host-of-cop26-but-divided-on-its-role-in-the-world/,Opinion – Scotland: Host of COP26 but Divided on Its Role in the World,Anthony Salamone,Nov 2 2021,"Global attention has turned to Glasgow, Scotland’s largest city, for the November 2021 UN Climate Change Conference – COP26. For the world leaders and negotiators in attendance, and those watching from a distance, COP26 represents a crucial test of our collective action, or inaction, in the face of manifest and worsening climate change. For the host country, COP26 means that and something more. Beyond the climate politics, the conference reflects Scotland’s uncertainty about its political future and its role in the world.Scottish politics is defined above all by its independence debate. At present, public opinion on the issue is fairly evenly split. The Scottish Government and the UK Government remain engaged in a long-running, though currently dormant, dispute over holding a new independence referendum. Observers should keep this context in mind when viewing the domestic optics of COP26. The UK Government is the official host of the conference. It holds the COP26 presidency and it is negotiating on behalf of the UK as a whole. The Scottish Government has no direct role in the negotiations, but it is responsible for local infrastructure and logistics — and it will seek to make its voice heard on climate change throughout the COP nonetheless.The hosting of COP26 is embedded in the Scottish independence debate. Both governments will use the conference to promote their differing visions for Scotland’s future: as a continued part of the UK or as a separate state. London will want to show that the UK remains a force in the world and that Scottish independence is unnecessary, if not dangerous. Edinburgh will make the case that Scotland would thrive as a European small state which was part of the EU. These arguments will be weaved, mostly subtly, into the two governments’ engagements around the COP. The principal target of these efforts will be the Scottish public, rather than conference-goers. In any event, UN delegates will undoubtedly be focused on climate negotiations, not Scottish politics.The Scottish political class likes to think of Scotland as an internationalist country. That belief is one reason why most of it opposed Brexit so emphatically. Before the UK’s 2016 EU membership referendum, only a small number of Scottish politicians genuinely wanted to leave the EU. Yet, for all the interest in and enthusiasm for COP26, Scottish political debate on EU and international affairs is largely superficial. Discussion is often reduced to points for or against independence, disconnected from the substance of global events and Scotland’s relationship to them.Scottish institutions have no legal powers on foreign and defence policies, which remain with London. Nevertheless, a soft-spoken political consensus used to exist that Scotland could engage in European and global affairs to a modest degree, without calling its constitutional position into question. The Scottish Government has a small international development programme, for instance, focused on Malawi, Pakistan, Rwanda andconsensus was shattered by the realisation of Brexit (which the Scottish electorate did not support in the 2016 referendum). Now, the Scottish Government’s interactions with the outside world are increasingly viewed, by both sides of the argument, as merely an extension of the independence debate. The government’s opening of representative offices in different EU member states has been a particular point of contention. Seemingly unconcerned by these divisions, the Scottish Government, run by the pro-independence Scottish National Party, aims to increase its global profile even further. Climate diplomacy is a priority area. It wants Scotland to be known as ambitious and progressive on addressing climate change.The Scottish target to achieve net-zero carbon emissions is 2045, which is five years ahead of London’s 2050 target. The Scottish Government even published its own Nationally Determined Contribution (a climate action plan), as if it were a signatory to the Paris Agreement in its own right. The full picture is more mixed. Scotland has long been an exporter of fossil fuels, in the form of North Sea oil and gas. It has missed its last three annual emissions reduction targets. In advance of COP26, the Scottish media chronicled ongoing environmental problems across Scotland, including polluted rivers, poor air quality and weak energy efficiency ratings of COP26 venues.Moreover, the Scottish Government is in an awkward position. The signature UN climate change conference is being held in Scotland, but it is not part of the negotiations. It is challenging to show climate leadership from conference fringe events. In time, COP26 may be remembered as a success or a failure in facing climate change — and it could influence Glasgow’s and Scotland’s reputations accordingly. Either way, the Scottish Government has little power to shape the negotiations or their outcome.Instead, the UK Government is the president of COP26. It is responsible for the conference, and it will receive the plaudits if a substantial outcome is achieved. London is also concerned with more than just climate politics. Maintaining public support in Scotland for the British union, and against Scottish independence, is one of its central goals. It certainly chose Glasgow as the host city for COP26 to demonstrate what it considers to be the UK’s international strength and prestige to Scottish voters.Throughout the conference proceedings, the independence debate will never be far away for the local audience. The various meetings, photo ops, and side events of the Scottish Government and the UK Government will be scrutinised for coups and snubs that can somehow be connected back to the constitutional question. Some supporters of independence see COP26 as an opportunity to promote their cause to a global audience. However, if the world looks to Glasgow for climate action, and finds that Scotland is instead talking about itself, that would hardly be an ideal image for the host.Scotland may be an internationalist country, but it is also profoundly unsure of its political future. It could remain a constituent of the UK, an ex-member of the EU with a remote relationship to the bloc. It could become an independent state, likely as a more normal EU member committed to the European project. That debate on Scotland’s future will continue for some time. Alongside its global significance, COP26 exposes the deep divisions which shape Scottish politics. Whether on climate change or wider issues, the lingering question remains: How much can Scotland meaningfully contribute to global debates when it is so undecided on its own role in the world? "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/11/01/la-patrulla-feminista-feminist-grassroots-interventions-in-southern-mexico/,La Patrulla Feminista: Feminist Grassroots Interventions in Southern Mexico,Franco Laguna Correa,Nov 1 2021,"Right on the International Day of the Girl Child (October 11), the capital of Oaxaca¾in southern Mexico¾witnessed the emergence of the feminist collective “La Patrulla Feminista” (The Feminist Patrol). The main purpose of the feminist collective is exposing local fathers who haven’t paid their child support, some even for years, without any action from the local authorities. Since October 11, “La Patrulla Feminista” has been patrolling through the city of Oaxaca making stops in the addresses of the fathers to hang up their photographs on the façade of their houses (and in some cases, members of “La Patrulla Feminista” even dared to smear their doors and façades with fecal matter). These fathers were identified by “La Patrulla Feminista” through the multiple denounces made public by courageous ex-wives and ex-partners.Many women from Oaxaca have joined “La Patrulla Feminista” movement, which now is comprised of more than three hundred women. As it was expected, the coverage of the grassroots movement has reached millions of people through social media and the national news outlets. As for today, there are various public “tendederos” (clotheslines) exhibiting the faces of the most notorious fathers that have been denounced, which include men who were municipal presidential candidates and local politicians. The ultimate purpose of “La Patrulla Feminista” is to take the cases of the unpaid child support to the national senate with the purpose to force the parents to pay their debt or be legally punished. However, many women have expressed their fear to be condemned by local authorities or be assaulted by their ex-partners in retaliation to their denounces.In 2019, according to data provided by a report issued by Mexico’s Executive Secretariat of Citizenship Protection, ten feminicides were perpetrated at the national level on daily basis. In 2020, these numbers went up at disproportionate records. However, this data doesn’t take into consideration the complaints of sexual abuse, sexual harassment, family violence, and the various forms of rape that the report provides in relation to women. Thus, the emergence of “La Patrulla Feminista” in Oaxaca¾one of the most dangerous Mexican states for women, indigenous people, and Afromexicans¾fills a gap in terms of grassroots organization that through overt, and even radical, feminist maneuvers challenge local authorities to force them to take a step further in both the contention and eradication of gendered and racialized violence in Oaxaca.Oaxaca is one of the Mexican states with the highest levels of murders at the national level. It is well documented the contemporary paramilitarization of various Meican states, where most of the population belongs to an indigenous ethnicity or identified as Afromexicans. Oaxaca is the state with the highest national percentage of speakers of indigenous languages. It is not only the historical homeland of the Mixtec people, the third largest ethnic group in Mexico, but also in the Costa Chica of Oaxaca¾shared with the neighboring state of Guerrero¾most of the Afromexican population of the country resides. In 2015, the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) included for the first time in history the ethnic identifier “Afromexican/Afrodescendent” in a preliminary census that reported that 1.2 million of the total Mexican population surveyed in the census identified as Afromexican.The alarming increase of violence in southern Mexico¾with a focus on Oaxaca, Guerrero, Chiapas, and Michoacán¾has made the Mexican local and national authorities surrendered to a “pandemic of paramilitary groups.” From the Ayotzinapa Massacre (Iguala mass kidnapping) in 2014, to the ongoing attacks perpetrated by paramilitary groups with strong ties to drug trafficking that target indigenous and Afromexican peoples across the country, not to mention that Mexico’s bio-cultural diversity is also in peril due to paramilitarized violence. In a study published in 2020, Omar Vidal and Richard Brusca established the correlation between the endangerment of both biological diversity and linguistic diversity in Mexico, placing the states of Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and Michoacán as the states that harbor most biological and linguistic diversity in thea study published in 2017 by The Wilson Center, a team of six experts from the Mexican Institute outlined that the main causes of the rise of violence in Mexico, based on murder rates, is due to: 1) the increase of conflict between criminal groups, without disregarding that this is a byproduct of the state’s own strategy to fight these criminal groups; 2) the lack of capacity of local authorities to contain criminal groups; 3) the impunity fostered by the state at both the federal and state levels; 4) the complexity of the nature of the origins and evolution of violence in Mexico; and 5) the violence directed towards journalists, local social leaders, and other independent voices that bring to the surface those voices that are silenced under various forms of threats, which makes public security more difficult.So far, “La Patrulla Feminista” hasn’t declared any ties to any political entity, thus stating feminist self-determination as the only principle that is driving their public maneuvers. This way, “La Patrulla Feminista” adds another layer to other movements taking place in Oaxaca, such as the “autodefensas” (self-defense armed autonomous community-based collectives) that have grown also in numbers in the state as the means to defend their communities from organized criminal groups. In the state of Oaxaca, members of most of the 417 municipalities of the state have already enforced this “horrific and non-remunerated job.” In the Mixtec and northern regions of Oaxaca, where masculine migration to the United States is a historical phenomenon, women have also joined “autodefensas,” thus the feminization of the so-called “autodefensas” is not a new phenomenon in the southern state.Only a few days after the launch in Oaxaca of “La Patrulla Feminista,” in the neighboring state of Guerrero it made national news the case of Angélica, an indigenous girl that at eleven-years-old was sold to get into a forced marriage with a twelve-year-old boy. On October 14, Angélica escaped after four years being kept captive by the boy’s family and after various attempts of rape by the boy’s father. While the practice of “forced marriage” among indigenous communities in southern Mexico ¾including the states of Oaxaca and Guerrero¾ has circulated on regular basis among many national and international news outlets, Angélica’s case reignited at the national level the ongoing debate on women’s rights in Mexico.Many feminist groups in recent months have been demonstrating in the capital cities of the most populous Mexican states, with a series of even violent demonstrations by feminist groups in Mexico City, where the government had to place protection fences around the frontispiece of the National Government Palace in downtown Mexico city to avoid vandalism. Most of these feminist groups have been acting autonomously, thus evidencing a lack of cohesion among them. In a study that focuses on feminist movements in Mexico between 2019-2020, Lucía Álvarez Enríquez places the epicenter of these movements among the feminist youth on the Autonomous National University of Mexico (UNAM), where young women, not all of them students, have organized many sociopolitical maneuvers to close several universities and have carried on manifold public demonstrations to protest against the radicalization of violence against Mexican women in recent years.Furthermore, Álvarez Enríquez recognizes that these feminist sociopolitical maneuvers have emerged as new ones without paragon with former ones. Álvarez Enríquez points out that these movements are new because they lack a unified and specific leadership, while they also have witnessed the diversification of their main actors and have forged their own language to communicate their messages, often relying on the use of violence to shake and confront the official institutions and political groups that they are challenging. While it would be difficult to rationalize the current feminist maneuvers, some already radicalized, as one cohesive entity, “La Patrulla Feminista” is focusing on one aspect of the Mexican patriarchal system that other feminist groups have not denounceda corollary, according to scholars like Álvarez Enríquez, the future success of these feminists groups resides in creating channels to better communicate among themselves and potentially find points of encounter to establish a more cohesive and effective dialogue with society. So far, the response of the leftist Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been a lack of desire to establish an organic dialogue with these feminists groups and official institutions have enacted various forms of repressive measures in order to frame feminist groups as both violent and “toxic” for the fragile Mexican social order."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/28/troubling-international-human-rights-advocacy/,Troubling International Human Rights Advocacy,Yih Ren,Oct 28 2021,"With a rising debate over refugees from Afghanistan in the U.S.; the economic wrestling between China and the U.S. becoming more pessimistically influential; Covid-19 giving birth not to solidarity but an infodemic; bourgeoning land-grabbing power furthering climate change and causing environmental activists’ lives, and with people’s precious identities being their detriments, we need to declare our values, voices, and positionality to abolish colonial episteme and reconstruct our social relations into a plausible future. This article will begin with analysis of some issues, such as U.S.-China-Taiwan relations, concerning international human rights framing; Then, with a connection of global citizenship education and intercultural competence with human rights advocacy, I aim to denounce the clean-cut understanding of human rights and emancipation claims limited by discourse and nationalist education agenda as well as announce an opportunity brought to fruition to a global orientation, solidarity, resistance, commonwealth, and full humanity.International Human Rights: Universalism vs RelativsmHuman rights are rights with principles that every individual holds regardless of race, sex, nationality, and origins. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights composed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, the recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world. Unfortunately, in our days, universal human rights treaties are not yet shared and understood by all countries; and the rhetoric is often interpreted and manipulated to favor one or some States’ economic and political interests and ambitions. The failure to agree and enact substantive human rights practices and international laws reflects the cruel reality in our contemporary international society as the standards and commitments vary according to different national idiosyncrasies and cultures.The central debate is whether, in a given society, local religious, cultural, and political traditions can determine civil and political rights possessed by its citizens. On the one hand, some argue that international human rights laws and treaties are created for protecting the interests of the individuals, not the governments; and the States should serve the purpose, not draw boundaries to limit their citizens’ full human rights. However, many countries have contested this idea and tried to promote cultural relativism in any form to defend their authoritarian governmentality. Also, people criticize the universality of ideas and demands of human rights is highly influenced and regulated by the democratic West (see Renteln, 2013).For example, UN policies regarding female genital mutilation, cutting, or circumcision (FGM/C) are problematic and violate human rights to mobility, self-determination, and the practice of culture. The UN and WHO illegalize FGM/C procurers and criminally prosecute people who performed or received a procedure in the Mediterranean, Africa, and South Asia, but at the same time, these procedures are quite popular in the Western societies and called Hoodectomy as a cosmetic surgery jargon. Similar procedures in Western medicine are acceptable and beneficial for some who need the surgery for self-identification (e.g., sex-change surgeries), but in non-Western constructed medical knowledge and practices, they are deemed unconventional, dangerous, violent, and an abuse of women’s bodies. In communities where people see FGM/C as a cultural practice and necessity to conform to the need and the expectation of women, their willingness to undergo the procedure is now considered as self-disrespect and conservative, not self-definition and determination (Ball, 2018). Thus, to avoid being orientalist, essentialist, and understanding international affairs by only comparing to one’s worldview, we need to adopt an intersectional approach that not only emphasizes historical, cultural, and textual, discursive, institutional, and other structural dimensions that counter the intersection of identities (e.g., personal identity intersecting social construction) but also help empower agency and liberate self-actualization.example can be found in Christie and Roy’s (2001) book, The Politics of Human Rights in East Asia. They claim there is no delineated history of “human rights” in Asia as understood in its Western context. Compared to the wealthy and resourceful West, Asian or other Third world countries and people have a different set of ideas in terms of values, rights, and duties. Also, the relatively high rate of crime, violence, drug abuse and homelessness has led to believe that the Western model is inappropriate and a threat to national and societal security in Asia contexts. Their resistance to universal human rights has created tension with the Western States. China has long been criticized by the West, particularly the United States, for restraining civil and political rights to its people while still outperforming the majority of countries in average income growth. In recent years, China has expressed impatience with the international human rights community for discounting the efforts they have made to improve poverty, living conditions, and illiteracy and simply focusing on first-generation human rights (civil and political) with no appreciation of the complexity of the issue (Peerenbom, 2016) .On the contrary, with globalization dramatically changing the world dynamic, the West has also been criticized for having the wrong agenda in working with the East on human rights issues. The man-made human rights disasters in Yemen and Afghanistan were sparked and supported by the U.S. government and military force in the name of counterterrorism (Lackner, 2014); the Hong Kong crisis was also defended by the Western States in the name of freedom and liberation (Boyajian & Cook, 2019). Human rights became a tool for the West to vilify and sabotage the stability of the East in the international community, acquire geopolitical and economic advantage, and control over local natural resources. As we can conclude that hegemony can occur in the name of liberty, freedom, and advocacy of human rights (Schecter, 2010).The United States, China, and Taiwan relations are also perfect examples in revealing the complexities of power dynamics, human rights, colonization, democratization, and foreign politics. Taiwan’s frustration for its incomplete international status and growing democracy awareness have led to the disputes with mainland China’s aspirations for their alliance and harmony, but at the same time, Taiwan’s economic interdependence and necessary human contact with mainland China genuinely call for peace, balance, and cooperation from both sides. Externally, the U.S. plays an important role in influencing Taiwan-China-US relations. China sees the U.S. as a threat to their regime, and vice versa, the U.S. sees China as a threat to their democracy and neo-liberalist capitalism as well as economic, political, and military domination. Hereinafter, International human rights advocacy on an individual, interpersonal, and collective level, is complex and complicated (Lin & Krasner,2011).As a critical education practitioner, I recognize the potency of education that aims to give emerging ways of thinking, acting, and being and transform our society by emphasizing humanism (not humanitarianism), agency, and action can help us see through obscured social structures and power dynamics that affect our identity and simply lives and develop a social activist persona to challenge dominant culture and narratives that unequivocally marginalize the best interests of the people. Therefore, I present Global Citizenship Education and Intercultural Competence below to criticize the existing practices on international human rights issues anddevelop a prism that embraces full humanity and celebrate resistance across boundaries.Global Citizenship EducationNation-states exist in isolation as bounded totalities, and this idea, developed by David Held (1999), has influenced and even regulated the nature and position of education offered within nation-states, the English only Act in the U.S., Marxist Education in China, just to name a few. The idea of nationality and citizenship, which has been strongly politically asserted for a long time, does not necessarily promote cohesion, freedom, and mutual understanding, but purity, exclusion, and otherness. Then national education in the U.S. born out of the nationalist structure in the 19th century was first created to benefit not the entire nation, but the wealthy, the rich, and the powerful and for the poor and the disposable to follow and assimilate. Their voices, home knowledge, and cultures were deemed disloyal, unnecessary, and less American (see Garcia, O., Kleifgen, J.A., & Falchi, 2008 for the critique of English Onlythe age of globalization and internationalization, more and more people start to see nationalism, nationality and national citizenship are problematic and discriminatory, especially in the education realm. Global citizenship education (GCE), on the contrary, starts to get some attention for its emphasis on global competencies and humanistic (not humanitarian) values. However, GCE holds its criticism of being ambiguous and Eurocentric, but multiple scholars have developed different typologies to extend the conversation and the engagement for critical change. Oxley and Morris (2013)’ essay, Global Citizenship: A Typology for Distinguishing its Multiple Conceptions, left me a greater impression as it aligns with the mission of international human rights advocacy, which is to advocate for the enjoyment of full human rights for all. In their model, political global citizenship, moral global citizenship, economic global citizenship, and cultural global citizenship are highlighted to critique power relations, politics, and economic agendas interplayed in cases like Taiwan, China and the U.S. political wrestling game. Political global citizenship focuses on changing relations between the states and individuals; moral global citizenship raises empathy and understanding of human rights; economic global citizenship responds to the nature of the modern and globalized workforce, and cultural global citizenship emphasizes solidarities and awareness of human and cultural differences, and advocates equalities and people’s voices and lived experiences even you do not know them and have not met them.GCE has been incorporated into school curriculums and outside of school programs all around the world, countries including the U.S, China, Canada, Europe, and South Korea. However, GCE is widely recognized as merely the need for global skills and knowledge in most Asian countries, while GCE’s concentration on human rights in the West, is challenged by patriotism and imperialism. GCE is not merely about learning about the others, rather it suggests empathy, solidarity, and cultural sensitivity and critical thinking regarding all global issues (Ee Loh, 2013; Myers, 2008). To be sure, theoretical research and praxis will continue to mark the unfolding and expending of GCE, especially as technology ties the world even closer and more opportunities to engage in cirtical dialogues.(Inter)Cultural CompetenceUnderstanding culture is substantial. Culture consists of explicit and implicit patterns, symbols, beliefs that constitute the distinctive achievements of human groups. It reflects societal experiences that have been transmitted and shared across generations and geographic boundaries. Also, culture can be self-sufficient, depending on variables like language, sexuality, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, and so on. Certainly, it is a complex subject with a lot of changes and ambiguity during the current political climate. When there are so many changes in terms of diversity of the social, cultural, and political environment in our society, we de facto lack the most proper language to describe, conceptualize, and understand this phenomenon. Simultaneously, multiculturalism has been criticized for having an essentialized idea of culture and a top-down approach concerned with national identity and unity to diversify the society, but cultural competence with a series of attitudes, behaviors, and policies does recognize the value of culture, differences, and the provision of services that meet cultural needs. Further, living in a multicultural society, intercultural competence becomes a critical resource to boost transnational communication and exchange and create an integrated and cohesive social environment (Meer & Modood, 2012).As we mentioned above, self-determination of identity is not free of outside forces, powers, and interferences, but rather culturally constructed, socially embedded, and discursively positioned. Again, using Taiwan as an example, Taiwanese Chinese identity is complex. Their ethnic identity nested within a dominant national identity can compromise one’s cultural identity. Chinese and Taiwanese share common cultural roots, but they have become more politically separated. The co-ethnicities of Chinese and Taiwanese have become one of China’s knots in heart of unity, and Taiwan’s current dilemma of identity (Li,pedagogy that promotes intercultural competence allows social spheres to be places to foster self-awareness of their own cultures and awareness of other cultures, to increase acceptance, adaption, and integration when communicating with other cultural perspectives, and to facilitate the navigation of their preserving identity and understanding other cultures. These forms of understanding and knowledge should not be exclusively constructed in classrooms; for all people, not just those who are culturally, and linguistically diverse, intercultural competence building can help guide their exploration of identity, culture, and meaning of life, especially in this fast-changing and dynamical world.Final ConsiderationsAbove all, my discussion is roughly holistic, but as I feel the urgency and significance not only to capture the forces that have given the current international human rights advocacy its shape and attempt to identify its essence but also to propose possibilities to be fully recognized and to live collectively with strong agency and power to participate in decision-making. To understand the situation, intervention, and transformation requires an awareness of objectivity and subjectivity and their dialectical relationship. International human rights advocacy does not simply fall into either verbalism or activism. Rather, its critical form develops between the praxis of annunciation and denunciation. It acknowledges that limiting elements in our objective reality that have deterministic power, but at the same time, our awareness of the situations and commitments to transform lie against the affirmation of our determination. Andre Lorde (2007) says the master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house. However, pedagogies like global citizenship education and intercultural competence believe in the possibility of education of all students, challenge neo-liberalist and colonial projects and ideology, and conjure a new way of seeing the world and taking actions against human suffering to resume commonwealth and full humanity. Speaking back to Audre Lorde’s notion, I believe with radical and humanizing pedagogies, hope, and solidarity, I believe that one, I mean people, can dismantle the master’s house with the master’s tools.Acknowledgement: Many thanks to Michelle Sun and Jordan Merrifield for contributing your inspiring thoughts."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/27/opinion-the-status-of-chinas-confucius-institutes-in-american-universities/,Opinion – The Status of China’s Confucius Institutes in American Universities,Craig Myers,Oct 27 2021,"Great Power competition normally plays out far from the classrooms where the concept is studied as international relations theory. But sometimes it occurs just outside our windows. Over the past 1½ years, a “soft power” skirmish in that IR conflict has reached critical mass as dozens of U.S. universities have broken ties with Confucius Institutes (CI) sponsored by the People’s Republic of China. Two Universities central to my academic life and career are on this ideological front line—my alma mater Troy University, and Middle Tennessee State, where I work and study International Affairs. With this debate reaching its zenith just as I began studying IR, I began to view the issue from that perspective: Is the demise of CIs is a U.S. victory over Chinese propaganda, or merely a strategic retreat by the Chinese after accomplishing their goal?MTSU broke off a 10-year relationship with its CI in August 2020, at the height of the COVID pandemic. With most faculty, staff, and students working from home and interacting through ubiquitous Zoom, not many noted the move. As with many universities that have rejected CIs, the official explanation was vague:Simply put, we are unwinding our contractual relationship with Confucius Institute. We no longer accept funding from CI or engage with them in programming. Meanwhile, our Center for Asian Studies, formed by MTSU in 2009, coordinates our remaining academic ties with universities in China, and works to develop and expand opportunities with institutions throughout the region. – Robert Summers, MTSU Vice Provost for International Affairs.The Confucius Institute Headquarters known as Hanban was founded in 2004 by former Chinese vice premier and Politburo member Liu Yandong to “promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries.” When MTSU opened its CI in April 2010 through a partnership with Hangzhou Normal University, there were 322 CIs in 96 countries and regions around the world. That would peak at 541 institutes worldwide including nearly 100 at American universities. Starting in 2014, however, many U.S.-based CIs began to close and since the start of 2020 there has been a landslide of nearly 50 contracts terminated. In Tennessee, the move was partly due to growing political pressure. Gov. Bill Lee called on the Legislature to ban CIs from state universities. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, and colleagues introduced a bill seeking transparency in university-CI relationships. A version was approved by the Senate in March 2021 calling for:delineation between a CI program and a university’s own Chinese language programremoving the Chinese assistant director position from institutessubjecting the staff and professors to appropriate background checksending confidentiality in CI-university agreements and making them publicly available online.MTSU’s involvement with its CI was extensive and high-profile. In December 2013, MTSU President Sidney A. McPhee received Person of the Year honors from the global organization of Confucius Institutes. He was one of 30 university presidents or heads of CIs to receive the award presented by Yandong during the eighth annual Global Confucius Institute Conference in Beijing attended by 2,200 people from 110 countries. China Agricultural University in Beijing named McPhee as an honorary professor in May 2007, and he was appointed in October 2010 as senior adviser to Hanban. Over the years, MTSU’s institute offered Chinese language and music studies, cultural events, and even Tai Chi lessons. Most significantly, the institute helped local K-12 schools offer Chinese language programs and led students and school officials to China for educational collaboration and exchange. Participants mostly paid their own expenses, but some housing and travel costs were covered by grants from Chinese sources including Hanban, according to reports. The substantial relationship made the quiet nature of the split more notable. But such vague explanations are typical following a CI-university breakup. Peterson, (2021) described it as follows:Few colleges and universities close Confucius Institutes for any of the reasons urged by state and federal officials… A university official who cites national security is a rarity. Only two—at Texas A&M and the University of South Florida—did so. Even rarer is one who cites academic freedom. Not a single one did.Some of the closure battles have been high-profile. For example, Tufts University’s decision came after months of protests by local Tibetan, Taiwanese, Hongkonger, Uyghur, and Chinese residents, who also sent nearly 600 letters to the university’s president. But Peterson (2021) argues it was an illusorycould close the Confucius Institute without offending Chinese government sponsors because the Chinese government isn’t prioritizing Confucius Institutes anymore. … American academia, with its cutting-edge technology, access to American thought leaders, and ability to shape future generations of American citizens, remains a top target for the Chinese government. But China knows that Confucius Institutes have become politically toxic, and it has shifted its focus toward other means of engagement.Meanwhile, Troy University is stubbornly attempting to keep its CI against the trend of closures. As of this writing, Troy’s CI is still active. Peterson writes that Troy convinced the state Legislature to appropriate $6 million for a Confucius Institute building, and “foolishly signed a contract obliging it to repay 100% of China’s investment in the Confucius Institute, plus ‘legal expense’ and ‘indemnity for defamation,’ if the university breaks its contract early. Troy’s lobbyists have sought to stall a bill to bar CIs in the state,” Peterson writes. Troy President Jack Hawkins defended the CI in a letter to the Alabama Commission on Higher Education in 2020, touting its “many benefits” and denying any intellectual theft occurred during the relationship.What evidence is there that China is willingly abandoning CIs after achieving soft power goals? Studies led by University of Texas-San Antonio Prof. Donald Lien documented that the institutes help increase trade and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow between China and host nations.Lienwrites: “Some have suggested the Institutes were put in place specifically for the purpose of enhancing China’s soft power … While soft power is difficult to quantify, our results indicating that China’s trade and FDI have increased after CI establishment are consistent with this view.” (Lien et al, 2011) Lien et al conclude that a new CI “does not have a significant impact on China’s exports, “yet increases more than 48% (but less than 118%) of China’s outward FDI.” For their developing country sample, they found that a CI “increases trade by a minimum of 4% and a maximum of 27%, while enhancing FDI by at least 46% and a maximum of 130%.” (Lien et al, 2011) Subsequent studies by Lien and colleagues continue to confirm this principle for all such cultural centers:Once a cultural institute programme is created in a country, one can expect a positive effect on foreign trade and the level of FDI from each additional cultural institute established in that country. Most importantly, given that cultural institutes are under the direct control of the policymakers, and that a substantial positive effect on FDI from a cultural institute has been documented, cultural institutes can serve as a particularly effective policy tool in promoting FDI with a much stronger effect from cultural institute host countries with developing economies (Lien et al, 2018).Hanban adopted an institute strategy similar to Germany’s Goethe Institutes, France’s Alliances Frances and the UK’s British Council. In a 2019 article, Xin Liu, a lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire, UK, highlighted similarities and distinctions between the CIs and the Euro-centric institutes. She argues CIs were part of a “counter-hegemonic stance” by China to fight a “’defensive’ battle against the West through ‘offensive’ expansion into overseas educationaldifference in operating models is surely a major factor that distinguishes the Confucius Institute from its Western counterparts, but it is an oversimplification to only focus on the visible difference in locations without challenging the roles of Orientalism and cultural hegemony, at the heart of which lie hidden differences in power positions in this uneven terrain. … The Chinese government’s role as both a sponsor and censor is another critical difference and a major factor that attracts scepticism. (Liu, 2019)Liu concludes that the European institutes, like the CIs, seek to “improve their international status and the position of their cultures in the global multicultural spectrum through the promotion of their languages.” But one of the stated goals of Hanban has deeper meaning: “To ‘enhance understanding’ is therefore the other task set for the CI with the hope of also constructing global legitimacy. As one scholar noted, ‘the founding of the CI is, by and large, an image management project . . . to promote the greatness of Chinese culture while counterattacking public opinion that maintains the China threat,’” Liu writes. Chinese rhetoric about the CI and its state-sponsored status has fed suspicions about its purpose, she wrote. For example, a Chinese report in 2007 called CIs the “brightest brand for China’s soft power.”U.S. academic groups have expressed concern that there are “strings attached” to a university’s partnership with a CI. Lie (2019) writes:There are still worries that those who pay the piper may call the tune. The common list of censored topics includes the ‘three Ts’ (Tibet, Taiwan and Tiananmen), human rights, China’s military build-up, and factional fights inside the Chinese leadership … In other words, it is the government’s role as sponsor and censor that lies at the core of such worries.Meanwhile, diplomatic reciprocity has been an issue as well. American efforts to start similar centers in China have been stymied. American Cultural Centers sponsored by U.S. universities were proposed for cities across China. The U.S. Department of State funded a total of 29 ACCs, of which seven were supposed to have opened but never did (Lien, 2021).One of the most controversial IR ideas is Samuel Huntington’s “The Clash of Civilizations,” which posits that Great Power conflict is driven by competition between regions of the world distinguished by history, political philosophy, religion, and language. As an IR student, it sometimes seems selecting one theory to account for all nation-state conflict or cooperation is a forced and false choice. Indeed, the U.S. has followed an alternating and sometimes simultaneous realist-neoliberal foreign policy over the past 60 years. Some say the clash of civilizations is an incomplete explanation of the world system, or even xenophobic, but surely a clash is at work in the CI debate? Is it too much to argue that Western “civilization,” with all its flaws, is preferable to that which is currently being practiced and promoted by the PRC? Duerr writes, quoting Huntington: “The futures of the United States and of the West depend upon Americans reaffirming their commitment to Western civilization. Domestically this means rejecting the divisive siren calls of multiculturalism. Internationally it means rejecting the elusive and illusory calls to identify the United States with Asia.” (Duerr, 2018) The ultimate irony is that Confucianism is not the religion of modernseveral decades earlier, during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76, Confucius was reviled, seen as an obstacle to social change and a throwback to the past. Now, however, Confucius is back in fashion, useful for the government that needs symbols to unify the nation and lending a basis for ideas such as the ‘harmonious society,’ which is essentially a Confucian concept … Whether China’s soft-power projection succeeds will ultimately depend on the sources from which soft power derives––a country’s culture, the attractiveness of its political values, and its foreign policies. (Paradise, 2009)It is no coincidence so many CI agreements concluded since the start of the COVID crisis. The PRC’s handling of the catastrophe illustrates why these partnerships had to end. Beijing has accepted no responsibility and has not even helped scientists discover the origin. Add to that its aggression against Taiwan and Tibet, crushing democracy protestors in Hong Kong, persecuting Christians and practitioners of Falun Gong, and reported genocide against the Muslim Uyghurs. The PRC is spreading billions around the world as part of its Belt and Road Initiative to buy support for replacing the “Washington Consensus” of development based on free market and liberal democratic principles with something chillingly called the “Beijing Consensus.” For all these reasons, MTSU was right to break ties with its CI, while maintaining other avenues of engagement with Chinese language, culture, and especially students. Troy should do the same soon.As Peterson (2021) pointedUnited States is headed toward a post-Confucius Institute world. The Chinese Communist Party knows that and is prepared. Chinese government influence is appearing under new names, in new guises. Our colleges and universities must have the strength of character to resist.Regardless of whether academic interference or intellectual property theft are proven, whether the benefit of increased trade and FDI goes both ways, or whether universities and the surrounding community benefit from this relationship, the PRC’s PR professionals did not need an office on American campuses as Great Power competition moves beyond the “soft power” stage."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/25/opinion-saving-myanmar/,Opinion – Saving Myanmar?,Martin Duffy,Oct 25 2021,"In over three decades at the coalface of United Nations fieldwork, the scenes witnessed by the author during humanitarian service in Myanmar in the past two years, are among the worst visited on any people, in any part of the world. Having served extensively in the Congo, Afghanistan, Sudan, Somalia, Syria, Rwanda, Cambodia, and Tigray, these conflicts all brought their unique challenges, but there is a desperation to the Myanmar situation that exceeds even the misery of those other notorious conflicts. First, the Myanmar crisis has created the world’s largest camp of displaced populations. Second, the country is ridden with internecine, intractable and atavistic ethnic conflict of a brutality seldom evidenced in the modern world. And finally, as of February 2021, the entire country, and its sprawling communities of the displaced, has just imploded in a vicious coup.Myanmar once again leaves all those advocating human rights with a sense of deep despair. Military rule in all but name, the violent suppression of protest, the incarceration of the innocent, and the fate of the displaced, all cry out for international action. Yet virtually the only moral victory achieved so far is ASEAN’S token rejection of the country’s military thugs at its own far from scrupulous diplomatic table. Street resistance has been ongoing throughout Myanmar since the army took over on 1 February 2021, suffocating a legitimately elected government and effectively disappearing its leadership. Elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party are among those detained (Cuddy, 2021.)Thousands of innocent people, many of them accidental casualties of state crackdown, have been murdered. Yangon, Mandalay, and the diplomatic enclave of Nay Pyi Taw have run with the blood of fervent popular protest. With a yearlong state of emergency, and media suppression, the outside world can only imagine the unspeakable brutality perpetrated by an illegitimate junta impervious to outside scrutiny. “Elections are easy”, a veteran politician in a neighbouring country told me once, “It is the results which are difficult”. In the face of another landslide victory by Ms. Suu Kyi’s NLD party the junta plainly knew their pseudo-government’s writing lay on a blood-stained wall.The Myanmar armed forces had backed the opposition, who were demanding a rerun of the vote, claiming widespread fraud which the election commission declared as totally unsubstantiated. The generals are not good listeners. Thus, the army coup took place precisely as a new session of parliament was scheduled to open, and with the country’s legitimate leader behind bars. Ms. Suu Kyi remains “vanished”.Worryingly, Ms. Suu Kyi’s location remains a state secret. She is still under criminal investigation for an assortment of grave charges, including violating the country’s official secrets act, possessing illegal radios and for public statements that may “cause fear or alarm”. NLD MPs who avoided arrest formed a new group in hiding. Their leader has urged protesters to defend themselves against the crackdown. The military commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing has taken power. Min has long wielded significant political influence, successfully maintaining the power of the Tatmadaw – Myanmar’s military – even as the country acquired a cosmetic facade ofhas received international condemnation and sanctions for his alleged role in the military’s attacks on ethnic minorities but is quite impervious to censure, almost relishing public protest as evidence of positive effect. Knowing how much Min relies on soothsayers, Min’s actions follow his latest astral advice In his first public comments after the coup, Gen Hlaing sought to justify the takeover. He claimed the military backed the people and would form a “true and disciplined democracy”. This proclamation was made even as Rangoon’s detention centers were packed to capacity with genuine democrats and the streets ran with the blood of protestors. In that light Min’s claim that the military will hold a “free and fair” election once the state of emergency is over, must be taken with great circumspection.An uneasy peace had characterized the last two years of the “pseudo-democracy” the military had reluctantly tolerated and now (predictably) protests over the coup have been the largest since the so-called Saffron Revolution in 2007, when thousands of monks revolted against the military regime. The credibility of “the Lady” had been dented by her appearance at the Hague, and as the Burmese public anxiously awaited how the generals would react to unwelcome news from the polls. Perhaps the only glint of optimism is that even if Ms. Aung’s fall from grace is fatal, the pro-democracy movement has now developed an autonomy which can exist independent of any leader.In Myanmar, the backbone of protest are the professional classes. The poor are so immiserated and vulnerable to reprisal to risk defiance of the army. Protesters include teachers, lawyers, students, bank officers and government workers. The military has imposed ignominious restrictions, including curfews and limits to gatherings. Security forces have used water cannons, rubber bullets and live ammunition to try to disperse protesters. The protestors kept on coming which is itself a testimony to the popular fervor which underlies Burmese democracy.On 27 March, in the deadliest day since the coup, more than 100 people were killed. There have been several days since where there has been an equal loss of innocent life, and still international action has been limited. The ineffective powers of the United Nations have been exposed, such as might bring tears to former Secretary General U. Thant as he lies reposing in his modest mausoleum close to the gilded stupa of the Shwedagon Pagoda.Aung San Suu Kyi had become a global icon in the 1990s for campaigning to restore democracy. She had spent 15 years in detention between 1989 and 2010, after organizing rallies calling for democratic reform and free elections. She was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while under house arrest. In 2015, she led the NLD to victory in Myanmar’s first openly contested election in 25 years. Now (alas) many see her as Myanmar’s democratic icon who fell from grace. Ms. Suu Kyi’s international reputation has suffered greatly because of Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya minority.Myanmar considers the Rohingya simply as illegal immigrants and denies them citizenship. Over decades, many have fled the country to escape persecution. Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to Bangladesh following an army crackdown in 2017. Ms. Suu Kyi appeared before the International Court of Justice in 2019, where she denied allegations that the military had committed genocide. Her reputation has never quite recovered. Numerous countries have condemned the military takeover and subsequent crackdown. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has accused the security forces of a “reign of terror”. The U.S., U.K. and European Union have all responded with targeted sanctions on the army. It has been to littleexpected, China blocked a UN Security Council statement condemning the coup, but has backed calls for the release of Ms. Suu Kyi and a return to democratic norms. The country has previously opposed international intervention in Myanmar. Southeast Asian countries have been pursuing diplomatic efforts to end the crisis. In one of the more significant affronts, the UN chief strategically delayed his ASEAN meeting to avoid the Myanmar army envoy (BBC News, 15 Oct. 2021). The army did not relish this public disgrace in front of their ASEAN neighbors, but Guterres decision comes as ASEAN prepares to hold further emergency meetings amid frustration at the Burmese military’s failure to implement the ASEAN peace plan.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres postponed a virtual meeting with ASEAN at the last minute to avoid the Myanmar regime’s foreign minister. The ill-fated meeting between the UN secretary-general and foreign ministers from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – including Wunna Maung Lwin, the foreign minister appointed by the military – is a tentative sign that the international community are resolute against the junta. However, it is troubling that Myanmar won’t allow ASEAN’S envoy to meet Aung San Suu Kyi. UN diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Guterres had a real headache over the decision by UN member states on who will sit in Myanmar’s seat at the world body. Rival claims were made by the military and Kyaw Moe Tun, the current UN ambassador who was appointed by the elected government.ASEAN agreed on a five-point consensus with Min Aung Hlaing in April, but the generals have made no progress in its implementation and have also ruled out allowing a regional envoy, Brunei’s second foreign affairs minister, Erywan Yusof, to meet Aung San Suu Kyi. The military was supposed to end its crackdown on opponents to the coup under April’s five-point consensus, but violence continues It also continues to crack down on those opposed to its rule, with at least 1,171 people killed since the power grab and more than 7,000 people arrested, according to local monitoring group the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. The army has also been accused of attacks in ethnic minority areas in the country’s border regions that have forced thousands to flee, as well as targeting churches and Christian clergy. The Rohingya and other minorities have also again suffered from the backlash.In an open letter ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, a group of regional lawmakers, urged ASEAN not to invite the regime to its summit because of its “blatant disregard” for the five-point consensus. ASEAN regretted: “A lack of decisiveness and consequences for the military’s total contempt for the ASEAN leaders’ agreement risks undermining the bloc’s legitimacy as a key regional player that can bring peace and stability,” said their letter, which was also signed by dozens of other civil society groups and activists. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken added his voice advocating with ASEAN: “to hold the Burmese regime accountable to the ASEAN Five-Point Consensus and facilitate a meaningful visit by ASEAN’S Envoy, Ambassador Erywan to Burma to include engagements with all stakeholders,” the State Department confirmed. The unscheduled virtual ASEAN meeting, hosted by Brunei, the current ASEAN chair, has only further enraged Myanmar’s junta according to multiple sources based in ASEAN member countries, including diplomats and government officials, in a communique to Reuters. A UN committee, which includes Russia, China and the United States, must consider Myanmar’s competing credential applications. The military has put forward Aung Thurein as its candidate for Myanmar’s UN seat.With no sign of junta retrenchment, the big question remains as to how even a vestige of Myanmar’s democracy can be salvaged from the spoils of coup. Once again, we are in the nation’s emergency room with Burmese protesters fighting to their last breath. Can any sense of Myanmar democracy be saved? Or the more pertinent question remains, was it ever anything more than a strategic illusion? Perhaps saving Myanmar belongs only in that filing cabinet of intractable conundrums along with the likes of Israel-Palestine or Western Sahara that just defy UN paracetamol. Ilan Pappe deftly portrays the Occupied Territories as the “biggest prison on earth” (Pappe, 2017). Here in Myanmar, humanity is tolerating the largest refugee compound the world has recently seen, and probably one of the greatest displacements of population in recent history. I am not sure it can be saved, still less that there is an international conscience resilient enough to apply more than a band-aid to the humanitarian and political disaster which is MyanmarAlice Cuddy , “Myanmar coup: What is happening and why?” BBC News, 1 April 2021“Myanmar Up-date”, BBC News, 15 Oct. 2021Human Rights Watch,Ilan Pappe, The Biggest Prison on Earth: A History of the Occupied Territories, Oneworld, Edinburgh, 2017.“Cox’s Bazaar”, 21 June 2021,"

Using the case of Mindanao, a southern region in the Philippines laden with history of fragility and armed conflict, this article finds that while FCAS areas tend to be with relatively weaker sources of structural power such as security and finance, the local businesses in FCAS have the potential to link to the global economy. The authors argue that the GVC participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) not only contributes to the structural power in the international political economy arena, but that it plays a crucial role in bridging the “isolation narrative” in subnational fragile and conflict-affected situations.Defining FCAS and GVC participation: Potential Nexus for International RelationsWhile literature on the business for peace underscores the private sector’s crucial role, there are few academic inquiries on the role of private sector’s linkage to global value chains as source of structural power in the context of fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS). There are numerous examples of successful hybrid business models for peace and reconciliation (Kolk & Lenfant 2016) such as in Colombia (Miklian & Medina Bickel, 2020) and in Sierra Leone (Ganson & M’cleod 2019). While this further supports the development-business collaborations as supportive to peacebuilding, case studies under this literature focus on peace and social welfare outcomes rather than linkage. Isolation narrative is one recurring issue raised in FCAS areas where it is found, for example, that the more isolated municipalities have higher presence of non-state armed groups (Miklian & Medina Bickel 2020, 700). In the FCAS context, isolation could also mean exclusion (Bujones et al. 2013, 15)from economic, social, and political decision-making and power-sharing. To begin with clarity, this section ties the definition of the two main concepts of analysis— the notion of fragility and conflict-affectedness and the concept of participation in the global value chains—and further provides an analysis in the succeeding sections on how the potential nexus contributes to structural power in international relations.Debate around the concept and definition of fragility and conflict-affectedness are earlier traced in the work of Mcloughlin (2009). Fragility is usually contrasted with states’ resilience or ability to perform certain functions that meet the expectations of its citizens. Mcloughlin (2009, 9) noted that scholars delineate fragile states from situations of fragility. The former definition was linked to states’ failure to uphold Weberian ideals while the latter recognizes a broader recognition that fragility can stretch beyond the nature and boundary of the state. This means defining fragility and conflict-affectedness requires looking at the “state of the society” which involves weak state and peacebuilding institutions that overall results in poverty and low economic growth. While different multilateral development agencies define fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS), this article uses the definition of Asian Development Bank for a simple reason – that the case analysed in this paper is in the Philippines which is part of the Asian context. Based on the ADB’s definition (2016, 4), a fragile situation refers to “a state’s failure to perform its core function effectively and provide basic social services.” This notion of fragility and conflict-affectedness as a “development dimension” (Bertoli & Ticci 2012) encourages the donor community to create tailor-made approaches that take into account the “idiosyncrasies of local contexts” (Desai et al. 2012, 55).Defining participation in the global value chain (GVC) is straightforward and requires defining what a value chain is and what participation means for firms in the global arena. A value chain, as defined by (Sturgeon, 2001, p. 12) is the “productive (i.e. value-added) activities that lead to and supportthe end use of a particular product or service, less the activities of the lead firm “, thus part of the global value chain can be done in a different country. This means that a raw material sourced from country A can be processed with added value in country B to be sold in another country C. This indirect linkage to global value chains is more evident in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Consistent with the Asian context, this study uses the definition of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) on SME internationalisation participation (Yuhua 2015, Section on ‘Forms of Internationalization’) referring to direct and indirect internationalization activities of SMEs as either direct exporting, direct importing, investment abroad, subcontractors to foreign enterprises, having foreign subcontractors, and cooperation with foreignthese two concepts of FCAS and SME participation in GVC could have potential implications on the conception of structural power in the international political economy arena. As discussed earlier, FCAS areas are observed to have the isolation / exclusion narrative as caused by conflict and fragility. One innovative way of bridging this isolation at the subnational state level is through subregional integration of poor areas of each country. One example is the Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) which has a unique membership—the country is not the member but rather the poorer subregions of the countries. While this type of integration contributes to opportunities for economic integration and development, there are critiques that homogeneous products in these areas could hamper the overall competitiveness of each member subregion. Nevertheless, this supports the idea that linkage of firms to the global economy contributes directly to the overall economic development. However, the question remains: how do these SME linkages to GVC—directly or indirectly—bridge the isolation / exclusion narrative evident in FCAS areas to further their subnational structural power? This is scrutinized further in the next section using Susan Strange’s treatise on States and Markets.FCAS and GVC participation of SMEs: Sources of structural power in the international political economySusan Strange (1988), in her classical treatise on the sources of power in the world economy, detailed how structural power determined the relationship between states and markets in the contemporary global context. Strange put forward that production, knowledge, finance, and security make up the pillars of power and authority, which shape and influence economic life. These structures of power go beyond the limits of traditional state borders and collude towards global integration of systems and have the ability to “decide how things shall be done, the power to shape frameworks within which states relate to each other, relate to people, or relate to corporate enterprises.” (Strange, 1988, pp. 25)The critical importance of Strange’s work relies on the understanding of the power structures as tools for ‘commanding heights’ on the world stage. Similarly, gaining access to these strategic sources of power—through world trade and some form of economic integration—has always been a struggle for many, depicting an arena of contestation for global political and economic dominance.However, as this nature of the global political economy progressed, we saw nations and regimes rise, with new powers challenging the old, while some losers continue to lag behind in this interplay of power and the economy, or in other words, the huge contest between markets and states. Yet, in the advent of a much more integrated world political economic system, we saw the continued emergence of situations afflicted by both fragility and conflict. In other words, while it is necessary to analyse sources of structural power at both global and national levels, it may not be sufficient. It is imperative to look closely into subnational contexts and hence, the authors attempt to reimagine Susan Strange’s States and Markets, specifically, by analysing how the GVC participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) not only contributes to the structural power in the international political economy arena, but how it plays a crucial role in bridging the “isolation narrative” in subnational FCASHence, we do ask, in theory, how do fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) gain access (albeit limited), to structures of power and the commanding heights? In a more practical sense, we ask, how do vulnerable economies or subnational cases have access to the world economy, to benefit from global trade and development?In their exploration of the effectiveness of aid targeting in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS), Carment & Samy (2019) forwarded that cycles of poverty will continue to affect fragile states and called for a re-examination of foreign-led interventions and aid by espousing a more ‘multidimensional approach to the identification and classification of fragile states (Carment & Samy 2019, 94).’ They proposed a framework that gauges the varying states of fragility focusing on three main factors, namely, authority, legitimacy, and capacity. They frowned upon the situation where aid is ineffectively poured because of the disregard by donor countries to the careful analysis of contexts, such as the lack of authority and legitimacy in their studied country-cases. In practice, this goes parallel with the Asian Development Bank’s operational approach in managing its FCAS interventions, which gives due attention to political economy analysis, dissecting issues of governance and binding constraints, and more deeply, “recognizing the interaction among fragile situations, weak institutions, and development activities” (ADB 2014,Espousing this approach of taking a closer look at particular social and political developments, Porter et al. (2013, 311), in their elucidation of the lack of effective institutions of justice and order in FCAS, called for the reimagination of the institutions of public order “beyond the laws, procedures, skills and technologies” and pushed for the examination of “elite bargaining, collective struggle and normative change that shape institutions.” While they mainly focused on analysing institutions of security and justice, it is important to look back to their case as they underlined the need for ‘rethinking donor engagement’ and concentrated on the comprehension of “how power is ordered, with networks of power(Porter et. al. 2013, 323).”From the above discussion, we carefully draw our main conceptions of the nexus between FCAS and SME GVC participation in the context of the international political economy arena. First, through Strange’s timeless analysis of the discursive relationship between governments and markets (led by the private sector), we come to understand how the private sector plays a crucial role in bridging the “isolation narrative” in subnational FCAS through SME participation to global value chains (GVC). Second, by not just looking at the power of government institutions and of the law, as what Porter et al. (2013) began to lay down, the merits of the discourse on power emanating from the market and the private sector revamps how we view structural power. That is, the private sector’s power which is contributory in nature to the overall structures comes with a certain level of independence rather than viewing this as overly dependent on the quality of institutions. To offer clarity, we discuss in the next section the case of SMEs in Mindanao, Philippines.Case in point: Linkage to GVC of SMEs in Mindanao, PhilippinesTaking the case of Mindanao—a region in the Southern Philippines with high poverty and history of armed conflict and fragility—this section explores the enablers and constraints for SME GVC inclusion in the context of FCAS areas. In the Philippines, 99.6% of firms are micro, small, and medium enterprises which contribute more than 60% of jobs. Evidently, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are major contributors to a country’s economy. However, SMEs are laden with distinct firm and entrepreneurial constraints. This can be further complicated by weaker institutions under a complex political economy such as in the Mindanao region in the Philippines.Looking at the indicators from the 2015 Cities and Municipalities Competitiveness Index (CMCI), data shows that Mindanao has few financial institutions compared to the other regions in the country. Apart from the lower quantity, the quality of these financial institutions is relatively inferior, that is, they have lower capacity for loans (i.e. pawnshop, financial cooperatives, and microfinance, and savings and loans association). In addition, 2015 Uppsala Conflict Data shows that Mindanao has a high prevalence of armed conflict accounting for more than 70% of 203 recorded conflict in the country that year compared with the low prevalence in Luzon (less than 10%) and Visayas (approximately 20%). This trend is consistent from 2008-2017. This evidence points to weaker sources of structural power discussed by Strange (1988) – security and finance – which FCAS areas tend to have.In terms of GVC participation, the number of SMEs that were able to link to the GVC directly or indirectly were estimated following the definition of APEC SME Internationalisation Participation (2015). Estimates based on the 2015 Annual Survey on Philippine Business and Industry (ASPBI) (Daño-Luna 2019) reveal that only 11% of total Philippine SMEs can link to GVCs while only 14% of these SMEs are from Mindanao.While the combination of these results implies that strong enabling environmental institutions are crucial for businesses not only to operate efficiently but to participate in the global value chains, it is important to note that nuancing is crucial to show how the private sector in FCAS operate. Interestingly, key informant interviews with different entrepreneurs in Mindanao (Daño-Luna, 2019) reveal that some SMEs, even while operating in the context of fragility and armed-conflict affectedness, are able to successfully link tointerview answers were analysed based on where the constraints, enablers, or motivations emanate from (i.e. entrepreneur, enterprise, or institutions). One of the notable findings from the interviews shows that a positive growth mindset of entrepreneurs are top enablers for SMEs, specifically in the services sector, to be able to participate in the GVC. For instance, one SME experienced poor internet connection and lost international clients but still persevered and sought the help of the local government unit to link them to clients through business matching and attending exhibitions. Moreover, an entrepreneur producing organic juice, despite losing a client due to travel restrictions brought about by the Mindanao martial law in 2017, persevered in applying for Food and Drug Accreditation (FDA) despite the tedious and bureaucratic process. This allowed her business to overcome an important business hurdle in exporting and have the accreditation as “ticket” in getting government export subsidies and support. Overall, strong business networks enable an SME to not only export but to also subcontract to exporting firms. In the case of one cacao business, they were able to reach wider clients by banding together with other cacao businesses to meet the volume requirement of clients. In terms of subcontracting to an exporting firm, a banana cooperative composed of former rebels were able to link to GVC by subcontracting to an exporting Chinese firm.The empirical evidence discussed above supports the authors’ argument that indeed there is potential for private sectors’ participation in GVCs to contribute to the structural power even in the FCAS context. Moreover, it aids the FCAS areas’ linkage to the global arena—thereby addressing the isolation narrative in FCAS. However, there is an important caveat that parallel strengthening of institutions and state-building (Asian Development Bank 2014, 2) in FCAS areas are needed for long-term support to the contributory power of SMEs linked to GVC.Conclusion and ImplicationsThis article veers away from the usual myopic domestic discussion of national laws and policies in the context of FCAS but rather focuses on the contributory power of private sector’s participation to GVC in linking to the international political economy arena. The authors argue that GVC participation of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) not only contributes to the structural power in the international political economy arena, but that it plays a crucial role in bridging the “isolation narrative” in subnational fragile and conflict-affected situations.The conclusions drawn do not in any way suggest to discount the important work of state-building and strengthening institutions. In fact, we highlight the findings that financial institutions and business organizations are significant institutional enablers for Mindanao SMEs to link to GVC. Moreover, making business renewal more efficient for SMEs is imperative given that Mindanao SMEs are prone to be in cities and municipalities with less efficient business renewal processes.This article hopes to shed light on two important implications. On the policy implication, this article finds that SMEs in FCAS areas are able to successfully link to GVC despite situations of fragility and armed-conflict affectedness with entrepreneurs having strong growth mindset and business networks. Therefore, we recommend that government policy explore incentivising SME attendance to mentorship training and business network matching. We propose that this should be with a clear goal of improving their participation in GVCs. On the theoretical implications, we suggest a future research agenda of studying fragile and conflict-affected situations in international relations and related studies, as a conscious and deliberate effort of the community of scholars to look into the contributory power of the private sector specifically in bridging the isolation narrative in the fragile and conflict-affected situations context.The authors are grateful to the DTI Competitiveness Bureau and Philippine Statistical Authority for the 2015 data on CMCI and ASPBI, respectively.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/23/space-stations-and-international-politics/,Space Stations and International Politics,Aleksander M. Lubojemski,Oct 23 2021,"The first space station, Salyut 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1971. Although it was only in orbit for a little over 170 days, it began a stream of newer and better versions over the years – from Skylab to Tiangong. These stations have become a feature of space exploration, forever transforming our views on how humans can interact outside of Earth for longer periods of time. Simultaneously they have broadened our understanding of biology, physics, astronomy and engineering. Space stations are not only objects of scientific interest. As with many aspects of the social world, they are objects of great power competition, social relations and cooperation. This article will focus on the intertwining of global politics and space stations, attempting to determine how space stations have influenced international politics. The International Space Station (ISS) and Tiangong as the primary case studies for three reasons. First, they are the most recent examples of functional permanent space stations in Earth orbit. Second, through its lifespan and influence, the ISS is arguably the most important space station that has existed. Through the changing nature of the international system, especially the rise of China, it is also a necessity to examine what role the Tiangong station plays, or will play, in global politics. Third, both are, or will be, based on broad international cooperation in general or specific aspects.The International Space StationThe International Space Station is a staple in the night sky, able to be seen by the naked eye. It has allowed humanity to better understand how humans live in outer space, as well as fostered international scientific collaboration on a wide scale. The station has been in orbit since 1998 and has been occupied for over twenty years. It is made up of 16 pressurised modules and is sometimes labelled as the most expensive human construction in history.The idea behind what is now known as the ISS arose during Ronald Reagan’s presidency (1981–89), long before the end of the Cold War. Although the space station never came into existence, the political dimension had already kicked in. First, the project was to be based on international cooperation, especially of like-minded states, but under clear American leadership (Logsdon, 1991). Second, the pro-democratic (or anti-Soviet) character of the station was underlined in its name – Space Station Freedom. Third, the political ambitions associated with the ISS are evident within his State of the Union speech itself, Reagan anticipating that America could “reach for greatness again” through “our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain” (Reagan, 1984). The participating states were to be close allies and well within their sphere of influence (Europe via the European Space Agency, Japan and Canada), countries that wish to “strengthen peace, build prosperity, and expand freedom” (Reagan, 1984). This project is a perfect example of how space stations intertwine with international politics – it was to be a tool in the ideological battle against Communism, show the technological superiority of Capitalism, and bind the American sphere of influence into a common undertaking.Yet it was only after the Cold War that the ISS came to fruition. The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 created a moment of unipolarity in the global balance of power, leaving the US as the sole superpower, allowing the country to dominate international politics. The Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA), which is the binding regulatory agreement regarding the ISS, gives testimony to this dominance. The first article states that partners “will join their efforts, under the lead role of the United States for overall management and coordination, to create an integrated international Space Station” (Agreement Concerning Cooperation on the International Space Station. With Implementing Arrangement, 1998). Although a collaborative project, there was a clear leader. This presented the US as the absolute forerunner in science and technology, a prestigious position that underlined the new balance of power. It may be that the American position itself gave the opportunity for such collaboration in the first place, by guaranteeing stability throughpolitical dimension during the establishment of the ISS did not end with the IGA. Wooing Russia into the project, especially under official American leadership, was an even more impressive political victory. As the successor state of the Soviet Union, America’s main adversary on the ground and in space, Russia’s accession into the ISS project gave a certain acknowledgement of the position the US had gained. The political dimension of Moscow’s partaking in the project goes even further than sole prestige. Washington was able to influence Russian policies in space technology, such as stopping the sale of cryogenic technologies to India (Chladek, 2017), and ensuring Russian scientists kept their jobs in Russia, thus stopping the possible dissemination of critical space technology to other nations (Moltz, 2011). By engaging Russia in the ISS, the US was able to successfully use the station as a tool in its diplomacy and leverage certain decisions that Moscow had to take to benefit from the ISS.It is nonetheless important to underline that while space stations influence international politics, they are also influenced by international politics – the ISS being a good illustration. The first major turbulence in cooperation on the ISS project began after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. NASA banned most contact with their Russian counterparts, after which Ditriy Rogozin, the head of the Russian space agency, tweeted that the US should deliver “its astronauts to the ISS with a trampoline” (Johnson-Freese, 2017). Furthermore, escalating tensions between Washington and Moscow over the past few years has put further cooperation in question. Russian leadership has at times given signals that they are thinking of ending the cooperation (Reuters, 2021).A fascinating case of the interplay between global politics and the ISS is the role of China. Beijing had tried for years to become a part of the space station, to no avail. NASA has been following an exclusionary policy against China for some time, citing worries about technology transfer (Moltz, 2011). An understandable concern, one that was also underlined in the case of Russia’s accession into the program. Russian involvement in the project however is a fact, despite fears of technology transfer. This shows that the policy towards China may be grounded in other aspects, such as in blocking the prestige stemming from participation or trying to keep American dominance and not give in to the rising superpower.The International Space Station has therefore been an object in international politics for over 20 years, witnessing many events and changes on Earth, especially in the political domain. The future of the station remains in question, with Russia’s growing hesitancy to continue the programme and the growing technical issues in recent years. It has been, and remains, a symbol of cooperation in space, built during times of global post-Cold War optimism.China‘s Tiangong stationIn April 2021, China launched the Tianhe module – the first building block in their new manned space station. Beijing had previously launched two smaller space laboratories as parts of the wider Tiangong space station programme, yet the Tiangong space station will be assembled throughout 2021 and 2022 and will be the culmination of the whole Tiangong programme. It will be made up of at least three primary modules, with more possibly being added to the future (Jones, 2021b). Its mass and size will be much smaller than the ISS, but more sophisticated in terms of technology, which will allow state of the art research and a continuous habitable environment for three people. The question to ask is: why is this so important for international politics?First, the Tiangong space station will be China’s first true permanent space station in Earth orbit, with the previous Tiangong-1 and -2 serving rather as tests for Chinese capabilities. As a result, the permanent space station will be the beacon of Beijing’s technological capabilities in outer space, similarly as the ISS was for the US. China’s space programme has always had a focus on prestige, both domestic and international (Sheehan, 2011). Thus, Tiangong will be the next step in showcasing the country’s development through theprestige element is crucial in understanding the interplay between space stations and global politics. With the shifting balance of power, prestige plays an important role in determining who is seen as the leader in various areas, such as technology. Developing a completely newpermanent and crewed space station is a good indicator of China’s ambitions in international relations, especially when one compares it to the ISS, which has been suffering paralysing technical issues (BBC, 2021).Second, although not multinational in nature as the ISS is, Beijing does envision international cooperation on the Tiangong space station. Up to date, many nations and organisations have stated their desire to take part in the venture, including the European Space Agency (The Guardian, 2021) and Russia (Jones, 2021a), with experiments from a multitude of research institutions from various countries to be carried out on the station (Mallapaty, 2021). Establishing international collaboration on the Tiangong station would be highly beneficial to China from a political perspective for two reasons: (i) China would show that they are building a new international coalition in space, affecting the balance of power in orbit and (ii) Beijing could use the space station as a tool in its diplomacy, as the US has with the ISS. The second aspect may become significant if the ISS would be decommissioned in the near future and the Tiangong station would become the sole permanent station in orbit, therefore conditioning access to the station based on favourable policies towards China.The Tiangong station is therefore a contemporary example of how politics and space stations interact with each other. The station is a representation of Chinese ambition in global politics, showcasing the technological advancements the country has made. Although still in the making, Tiangong is already becoming a crucial aspect of global space politics.Competing for dominanceThe shifts in the balance of power across the world, especially the rivalry between the US and China, have a direct impact on what is happening in our orbit, space stations not being exempt. Recently, NASA has been urged to not leave a “space station gap” after the ISS will be decommissioned (Foust, 2021). The space agency is currently looking at possibilities of commercial space stations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the same orbit the ISS and Tiangong stations use. Nonetheless, if the ISS programme were to end in the near future, Washington would have issues regarding their position in space, as Tiangong would be the only permanent space station in orbit. This could cause serious image problems for the US, contrasting with China and its new state of the art station.It may be that space stations are a representation of the current balance of power in Earth orbit. The International Space Station emerged during a time of US dominance on the global political scene, unifying old allies and former adversaries under its leadership. The stability of the programme began to decay when Russia’s geopolitical goals came into play, thus souring the relationship between Washington and Moscow. Furthermore, the rise of China and other actors began a shift in the balance of power, which was also seen in space through the ambitions China placed in their space programme. It is difficult not to see the symbolism of a decaying ISS under American leadership and a materialising Chinese Tiangong with more and more countries wishing to participate in the programme."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/18/opinion-chinas-belt-and-road-initiative-pragmatism-over-morals/,Opinion – China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Pragmatism over Morals?,Tabita Rosendal,Oct 18 2021,"Is China beating the US and EU through its pragmatic approach towards cooperation under the “Belt and Road” Initiative (“一带一路”倡议) (BRI)? Despite the advent of the US’ “Build Back Better World” (B3W) and the EU’s “Connecting Europe Globally” (CEG), evidence from Sri Lanka suggests that some countries still look to China for support due to the ‘no-strings-attached’ nature of its investments. The stark reality is that China’s “pragmatic values”, combined with loans, may outcompete the two Western initiatives.The US and EU forward their initiatives through a focus on Western values such as liberalism, democracy, freedom of speech, and human rights – all moral frameworks which supposedly lead to ‘good governance’ (US White House, 2021; EU Council, 2021; Yan, 2021; Pleeck and Gavas, 2021; Qureshi, 2021). Conversely, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holds that the BRI has pursued a pragmatic framework of non-interference (respecting sovereignty) and ‘win-win’ (mutual benefits) (FMPRC, 2021A; Ginsburg, 2021). In a nutshell, China claims to meet the countries where they are, with investments made in areas or sectors in which they seek support (Li and Vicente, 2020; FMPRC, 2021B; Wang and Cao, 2021: 65). Moreover, non-interference goes both ways: China remains pragmatic about cooperation and urges other countries to do the same, ultimately securing mutual political support in times of strife (China Power, 2017; Dezenski, 2020; Jie and Wallace, 2021). However, while countries do benefit from Chinese investments, China arguably remains at the head of the negotiation table, with its own interests at the fore (Rolland, 2017; China Power, 2017). But what does this mean in practice?The Belt and Road Initiative in Sri LankaIn recent years, Sri Lanka has been under international scrutiny due to (refuted) accusations of Chinese ‘debt-trap diplomacy’, i.e., that China has attempted to increase its economic or political leverage over the country through extending excessive credit that Sri Lanka could not repay – the main example being the 99-year lease of Hambantota Port to China Merchants Port Holdings Company (CMPHC) (Jones and Hameiri, 2020).However, the Sino-Sri Lankan relationship is long-established and has only picked up speed after the BRI’s announcement. The ties were already cemented during the Sri Lankan civil war; when the US cut off aid, China provided investments, armaments, and diplomatic support to the government (Marshall, 2009; Sakhuja, 2009). After the war, when Sri Lanka began investing in infrastructure projects to save its economy, China supplied alternative financing as opposed to the IMF and World Bank (Ferchen and Perera, 2019; Daily FT,Beijing has supported the elected governments of Sri Lanka since the civil war, this support has been piecemeal and problematic, not least due to Sri Lanka’s official policy of non-alignment and continuously close ties with countries such as India (Srinivasan, 2021A; Wignaraja, 2020). Indeed, tensions with the India-leaning Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government (2015-2019) proved difficult to tackle; as India commenced formal visits and proposed large investments, Chinese visits were curtailed. Nevertheless, China worked hard to regain its favor and ultimately succeeded after Wickremesinghe’s dismissal, when China-friendly Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister (Myers, 2020). By November 25, 2020, China was Sri Lanka’s largest lender, with loans around $923.7 million (Ada Derana Biz, 2020). To complement investments, Sino-Sri Lankan ties have been furthered in areas such as culture under the BRI’s ‘people-to-people bonds’, and ‘pragmatic cooperation’ has been enhanced so that Sri Lanka may learn from China’s governance practices (Srinivasan, 2021C).The Colombo Port City (CPC) is currently the main BRI project in Sri Lanka; with a stated aim of elevating the country to the level of a ‘small Singapore’, it is the single largest foreign investment in Sri Lankan history with a construction cost of $1.4 billion (Farzan, 2021; LKI, 2020; CHEC Port City Colombo, 2021). However, related projects exercise considerable influence. For example, the East Container Terminal (ECT) / West Container Terminal (WCT) of Colombo port are central to a dispute between Sri Lanka, India, and Japan (Javaid, 2021). The Sri Lankan government unilaterally reneged on the deal for India and Japan to develop the port in February 2021. It was quickly suggested by Indian, Japanese, and US’ sources, including state officials, scholars, and media, that China had pulled its weight in the port to block the advance of the two Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) countries (Manoj, 2021; Haidar and Srinivasan, 2021; Singh, 2021). India and Japan ultimately accepted Sri Lanka’s deal to develop the WCT instead, but speculation on China’s role never subsided. However, other players have had their plans in Sri Lanka foiled too.The US has attempted to counter China’s presence by forwarding strategic cooperation frameworks such as the Status of Armed Forces Agreement (SOFA), which the Sri Lankan government has yet to accept, along with the $480 million Millennium Challenge Compact (MCC) Accord, which the US terminated in 2020 due to a ‘lack of partner country engagement’ (Mendis and Reichenbach, 2020; Economy Next, 2020). Similarly, EU investment schemes in Sri Lanka such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) have been hit and miss. The country was excluded from the GSP+ in 2010 due to the Civil War, but the scheme was reinstated in 2017 (de Silva, 2020). However, in June 2021, the European Parliament adopted a resolution to temporarily withdraw Sri Lanka’s GSP+ status since the country has utilized the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) to detain critics, activists, and writers. This is set to severely impact Sri Lanka’s economy, as the EU is its second largest trading partner accounting for more than 22.4% of Sri Lankan exports in 2020 (ANI News, 2021; Srinivasan, 2021B).Meanwhile, China has not dialled down its efforts in Sri Lanka. In addition to infrastructure projects, China has provided economic support to the country during the Covid-19 pandemic and has donated a large quantity of medical equipment and vaccines through its ‘mask diplomacy’ (Chandrasena, 2020; Karunatilake and Pal, 2021). These donations came when Sri Lanka was criticizing the West for turning its back on the nation. Conversely, Sri Lanka’s ambassador to China, Dr. Palitha Kohona, has stated that China will remain Sri Lanka’s ‘closest and most dependable friend’ no matter what the West or India says (Rutnam, 2021). Whether China’s friendship in Sri Lanka is genuine or not, one thing is certain: Xi is a close ally to current president Gotabaya Rajapaksa. However, growing criticism of the CPC along with other BRI projects may test this friendship in the future (Srinivasan, 2021A; Hundlani and Kannangara,question of human rightsAs illustrated, Sri Lanka has become increasingly isolated from the West due to its human rights violations during the civil war. Moreover, under the Rajapaksa government, conditions have deteriorated; Sri Lankan critics have been surveilled and harassed, and basic human rights for ethnic groups have worsened (UNHRC, 2021B; DeVotta and Ganguly, 2021). Nevertheless, Beijing has continued to help (Singh, 2018). China voted against the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) resolution on Sri Lanka’s human rights record in March 2021, but the resolution still passed. The Rajapaksa government now seems to have rejected the resolution, which risks further alienating the country from the West and the international community (Abeyagoonasekera, 2021).In return for this support, Sri Lanka has had China’s back. The government has publicly defended the BRI, refuted rumors of debt-trap diplomacy, enhanced military cooperation, and thus far, supported the CPC Economic Commission Bill which may further China’s interests (Rajagopalan, 2021). The two countries seem to have respected the core interests and sovereignty of their counterparts while backing each other in international controversies. This mutual, unconditional support – forwarded under the discourse of pragmatic cooperation – has ensured China’s position in the country.Time will tell whether Sri Lanka continues to rely on China for investments, or whether it will address its human rights issues and turn to other nations for support. Currently, the latter seems doubtful. Sri Lanka’s tilt towards Chinese pragmatic values will thus be at the expense of the Tamil population, human rights defenders, and journalists (Amnesty International, 2021).Money over morals?While we cannot generalize based on the case of Sri Lanka, it does point to a larger trend in BRI cooperation. Countries with problematic human rights reputations, such as Afghanistan (UNHRC, 2021A; Marsden, 2021) and Pakistan (HRW, 2021; Sacks, 2021), seem to favor China’s pragmatic approach and will likely continue to do so. Other countries struggling to uphold human rights and desperate for investments – developing or developed – could also potentially choose China as their partner (Faiz, 2019).Therefore, the US and EU may have overestimated the power of Western values as opposed to those associated with Chinese investments under the BRI. Even with the same amount of money for investments, China has a clear advantage: it does not impose conditionalities for aid, at least not like the West does (Dezenski, 2020). As seen in Sri Lanka, it is not a question of money or morals – it is a question of money without morals. Consequently, the B3W and the CEG will struggle to compete with China if the focus remains on forwarding infrastructure with Western values. For years, China has been cooperating with countries that the West would not consider due to their political systems or human rights approaches, and it has strengthened its own bi- and multilateral position through a focus on credibility and assuaging fears of the ‘China threat’. Therefore, despite criticism, the BRI – and the pragmatic values associated with Chinese investments – are unlikely to lose popularity any time soon."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/16/turkey-unopposed-in-the-eastern-mediterranean-sea/,Turkey: Unopposed in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea,Mark Bhaskar,Oct 16 2021,"The re-emergence of Turkey as a major military power has altered the dynamics of the Mediterranean, bringing together a diverse set of allies whose interests are threatened by prospective Turkish expansion. However, the gap in military power between Turkey and its adversaries is growing with few demonstrable measures taken by Mediterranean powers to compensate and rebalance the regional system. The imbalance is acute in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, where Turkey seeks to redraw maritime boundaries and repudiate treaties to enable its surveys for potential undersea hydrocarbons to address its rising energy demands.Over the last two years, the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) has developed a capable, expeditionary military force able to project power abroad into areas under the influence of modern great powers such as the United States and Russia. Turkey inflicted a strategic defeat on the former in October 2019, when a Turkish incursion severed the ground lines of communication of U.S. forces operating northeastern Syria, forcing American troops to retreat approximately 250 km to the eastern extremities of the country where they remain in small enclaves around Syria’s oil fields. Washington’s influence in Syria has never recovered. A few months later, the Turkish military fought the combined forces of Russia, the Syrian government, and Iran in Idlib Province in northwestern Syria. Though Ankara lost some ground, the Turkish military retained Idlib city center and has strengthened its position in the province to deter future attacks. In Libya, Turkey’s military intervention on behalf of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord ended the siege of Tripoli, defeating Russian and UAE mercenaries. Finally, in just over a month Turkey enabled Azerbaijan’s recapture of nearly half of Armenian-held Nagorno-Karabakh. Only the intervention of Russia prevented the wholesale destruction of Armenian forces.Despite these qualified achievements, the TAF continues to build its forces and widen the preexisting gap in military capabilities between Turkey and its multiple regional adversaries. Central to this buildup are the TCG Anadolu, a ship with the explicit purpose of amphibious assault operations, the MILGEM Project, which will furnish the Turkish Navy with a new surface combatant every year until 2030, and a line of unmanned missile boats. Turkey will equip their surface ships with the ATMACA anti-ship missile, successfully tested in June. Turkish defense industries have additional plans to build diesel submarines, landing ships, and minelayers that will further bolster the Turkish military’s advantage in the Eastern Mediterranean. This is not to mention Turkey’s acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defense system and its indigenously-produced short-range ballistic missiles, first used in Iraq against armed Kurdish groups in 2019. Underpinning these military reforms is the Mavi Vatan (Blue Homeland) strategy endorsed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2019. Per Mavi Vatan, Turkey intends to acquire additional maritime territory in the Aegean, Black, and Mediterranean Seas at the expense of Greece and the Republic of Cyprus (RoC). Small, lightly defended Greek islands such as Kastellorizo, Karpathos, Kasos, and Symi are obstacles to the full implementation of this strategy.Opposing Turkish expansion in the Mediterranean is an informal coalition of states that posses varying degrees of willingness and capability to demonstrably deter Ankara. The leading member of this coalition is France, the closest approximate to a regional hegemon in the Mediterranean Sea. In September, France entered into a mutual defense pact with Greece and pledged to provide Athens with three surface combatants (with an option for a fourth). This follows separate agreements for France to sell 24 Rafale fighter jets to Greece and a French carrier strike group patrol in the Eastern Mediterranean earlier this year. While significant, there is reason to doubt France’s commitment to an anti-Turkish mission. Though President Emmanuel Macron has emerged as one of the foremost champions of Kurdish nationalism, French military forces in Iraq and Syria remain focused on the Islamic State rather than helping Kurdish groups retake territory occupied by Turkey. Despite sending troops to aid the Libyan National Army’s campaigns against the Islamic State in Benghazi, the French military was noticeably absent as Turkish forces drove the LNA out of Tripoli and across central Libya. A French naval frigate, patrolling the Mediterranean Sea to prevent weapons from reaching Libya, fled after a Turkish vessel targeted it rather than risk confrontation. And in the case of the Nagorno-Karabakh War, France’s support for Armenia did not extend beyond rhetoric. When faced with opportunities to confront the Turkish military even by proxy, Paris has consistently backed down.Greece, despite being the nation most threatened by Turkish territorial designs, seems to lack both the capability and the will to blunt Turkish power. Since the creation of Mavi Vatan in 2006, Greek defense spending has declined 8 out of the intervening 14 years, including during the first year of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ administration. Mitsotakis has largely deferred the Eastern Mediterranean security issue to international arbitration rather than build the necessary forces and alliances to constrain Turkish behavior. Greek defense industries remain focused on intelligence platforms rather than kinetic systems more suited to maintaining Greece’s territorial integrity. The Hellenic Armed Forces also face shortages in manpower, armor, combat aircraft, artillery, and naval vessels vis-à-vis Turkey and a lack of combat experience relative to the TAF. Finally, Greece has handicapped the defense of its islands by generally adhering to a series of treaties prohibiting the militarization of the island chains closest to Turkey, making them attractive targets for the Turkishpaper, Egypt appears the logical counterweight to Turkey in the Mediterranean. The Egyptian Armed Forces (EAF) have numerical superiority over Turkey in almost all military systems and manpower. In June 2020, the Egyptian Parliament voted to send troops to Libya if the TAF continued its operations beyond central Libya, after which time Turkish offensives ceased. While its willingness to counter Turkey is clear, Cairo’s capability to do so is not. International observers note that the Egyptian military can neither maintain nor operate most of its equipment, to the point where it is doubtful that the EAF could have followed through on its pledge in Libya. Under President Abdel el-Sisi, the EAF has become more integrated into the Egyptian economy, which has eroded its professionalization and readiness to respond to crises. From a doctrinal perspective, the EAF remains focused on conventional military operations on or near its territory rather than expeditionary operations. Egypt also has far more pressing security issues close to home, with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam threatening its water supply and with a lingering insurgency by the Islamic State in the Sinai Peninsula.The RoC, Israel, and the UAE are often erroneously considered partners to the anti-Turkish coalition developing in the Mediterranean. From a military standpoint, the RoC is a negligible country whose security is entirely dependent on external guarantors Greece, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations. The RoC cannot be expected to contribute to an anti-Turkish mission outside its territory given the overwhelming superiority of Turkish military forces already occupying northern Cyprus. As for Israel, for all of the rhetorical blows traded by Ankara and Tel Aviv during the rule of President Erdogan, Turkey is Israel’s largest trading partner in the Mediterranean region. It is unlikely that the Israeli Navy, generally focused on small-scale operations in littoral waters, would send an expeditionary force beyond its borders to aid Greece, which struggles with anti-Semitism. Furthermore, Turkey and Israel also face a shared threat in the form of Iran. Tehran’s weapon shipments across Iraq and Syria in support of operations against Israel and its rocket attacks via proxy on Turkish forces in Iraq could serve as a springboard for future Israeli-Turkish cooperation. Finally, the UAE has opted for accommodation, rather than competition, with Turkey in recent months after defeats in Libya and Yemen showcased the limits of Abu Dhabi’s military power.If the aforementioned states wish to deter Turkish expansion, then all powers need to enter into a more formalized alliance. The mutual defense pact involving France and Greece is a start, but incomplete without the inclusion of Egypt, which is better positioned from a geographical standpoint to offer defensive aid to Greece. Instead of intermittent exercises involving Greece and either France or Egypt, the three countries need to conduct air, naval, and amphibious exercises in tandem on a regular basis if they intend to deter Turkish operations. Such an alliance would be lacking without an intelligence sharing agreement and joint operational planning for contingencies involving different expressions of Turkish power – which go beyond conventional military means and include the weaponization of refugees, hostage diplomacy, and diaspora mobilization. Most importantly, Greece needs to offer France and Egypt a permanent and joint military presence on a Greek island, such as Naxos, that could be prepositioned to intervene in the event of Turkish attack. Short of these measures, current and future Turkish leaders may reasonably conclude that given their military superiority over their lackadaisical regional adversaries that international borders areReading on E-International RelationsTurkey’s Operation Olive Branch: Why is Turkey Attacking the YPG in Syria?Turkey’s Role in Syria: A Prototype of its Regional Policy in the Middle EastTurkey’s Unholy Alliance in SyriaOpinion – Spain’s Request For NATO Coronavirus Aid: Will Turkey Answer?Turkey’s Operation in Syria and the Future of the Syrian Civil WarThe Turkish Referendum and Its Impact on Turkey’s Foreign PolicyAbout The Author(s)Mark Bhaskar is a PhD candidate in the School of International Relations at the University of St. Andrews.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/16/opinion-indian-politics-in-the-age-of-neoliberalism/,Opinion – Indian Politics in the Age of Neoliberalism,Yanis Iqbal,Oct 16 2021,"Ever since the implementation of neoliberal reforms in 1991, India has witnessed a drastic change in the internal mechanics of domestic politics. Parties have become ever more homogenous in their ideological outlooks – neoliberal orthodoxy and synthetic secularism now exist across the political spectrum, evident in the widespread cross-pollination between seemingly opposed parties. Instead of listening to and fulfilling the demands of the masses, parties are functioning as administrative agents of the contemporary Indian state. This has entailed the establishment of a very nebulous social basis and programme which incorporates and de-incorporates different politico-cultural idioms based on circumstantial conveniences.These structural shifts in the arena of Indian politics have rendered elections as a serial process – a process in which a passive collectivity is born whose members’ situational interaction is defined solely by the orientation of diverse existences and actions around a common set of material objects, forces and structures. With the abridgment of political parties to mere regulators of social discontent, voters no longer participate in elections as actively organized citizens. Rather, they become powerless individuals – abstracted from the praxis of the democratic group – whose only involvement in the electoral process consists in confronting the parties as receptacles of reified power.In “Critique of Dialectical Reason”, the French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre notes:[I]n bourgeois democracies, elections are passive, serial processes. Each elector, of course, decides how to vote as Other and through Others; but instead of deciding in common and as a united praxis with the Others, he allows it to be defined inertly and in seriality by opinion… electoral systems constitute the set of electors as a passive material for other-direction.To translate this into our present-day context, Indian political parties – insofar that they have become quasi-state apparatuses with a high degree of centralization – fabricate serialities that mediate between individuals as Others. Therefore, people don’t vote as practical subjects but rather as Others who are already embedded in an institutional matrix of manipulation.What does this manipulation consist of? It consists of the over-interpellation of individuals, the constitution of individuals as subjects not by one interpellation, but by multiple and contradictory interpellations. In other words, the individual is embedded in a network of different ideological discourses.‘Elections: A Trap for Fools’, Sartre writes:[W]hen we are called to vote, I, the Other, have my head stuffed with petrified ideas which the press or television has piled up there. They are serial ideas which are expressed through my vote, but they are not my ideas. The institutions of bourgeois democracy have split me apart: there is me and there are all the Others they tell me I am (a Frenchman, a soldier, a worker, a taxpayer, a citizen, and so on). This splitting-up forces us to live with what psychiatrists call a perpetual identity crisis. Who am I, in the end? An Other identical with all the others, inhabited by these impotent thoughts which come into being everywhere and are not actually thought anywhere? Or am I myself? And who is voting? I do not recognize myself anymore.The dispersion of Indian citizens into manifold identities generates a state of serial solitude wherein the subaltern possesses a consciousness that is refracted by the prisms of discordant interpellations. The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) has won elections by producing a structured combination of relations of subjectivity from this mosaic of historical accretions and ideological distortions. This has been done by allowing sublaterns to deposit their agony and anxiety – episodic and disjointed sediments of cognitive accumulation – into empty spaces of fears, fantasies and pathological hope where grievances can be amplified and semanticized but not solved. Intensification of confusion – through the mythologization and reactive intermixing of temporalities – has become the primary modality of extending hegemony.The Opposition’s failure to construct a viable counter-narrative against the ruling dispensation derives from its inability to dissever dominant codes of governance from its political strategy. Aijaz Ahmad remarks: “with the exception of the Left, there is no political party, including the Congress, for which the need to fight collectively for secular civility takes precedence over its own sectoral, corporate interest.” Consequently, the BJP’s toxic admixture of religious fanaticism and extreme capitalism has remained untouched. No forceful and dedicated effort is being made to break the shackles of seriality and re-integrate elections with the domain of social struggles.Verbal rhetoric in favor of the Indian people can’t substitute the development of movements which articulate a new national-popular will. A political identity is not a sociological substance – a misunderstanding manifest in the notion of vote bank. Robustly grounded and socially effective identities start from concrete practices which have the capacity to bring together what subalterns’ singularities have in common.In “The German Ideology”, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels comment: “The separate individuals form a class only insofar as they have to carry on a common battle against another class”. Thus, Indian politics needs to reject electoral objectification – the conversion of subalterns into electoral objects that are identical with all the other objects, differing from them only by their serial number. A radical imagination is required which foregrounds the democratic development of citizens. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/14/opinion-taiwans-almighty-squeeze/,Opinion – Taiwan’s Almighty Squeeze,Martin Duffy,Oct 14 2021,"Taiwan has emerged as one of the most enlightened democracies in Asia. Today’s Taiwanese enjoy an unrivalled level of public freedoms, untrammeled press, accountable governance, judicial fairness, as well as women’s, disability, LGBTQ and so many other rights which are the envy of its neighbors. All that has been achieved amidst a unique geo-political asymmetry which threatens at any time to engulf the Taiwan strait. Even As Taiwan celebrates “double ten” (the National Day of the Republic of China, marking the 10 October 1911 uprising against the imperial Qing dynasty and establishment of the Republic of China on 1 January 1912) the island’s future is threatened. During the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese government lost control of mainland China to the Chinese Communist Party and retreated to the island of Taiwan in December 1949. That delicate status quo achieved in 1949 is under unprecedented threat.Taiwan’s emergence as a trusted upholder of democratic principles and international standards of human rights has not been without hiccups along the way. Taiwan’s political “saints” proved no less susceptible to corruption and human frailty, and the realpolitik of the cross-strait war often meant diplomatic compromises which threatened even the most earnest of political ideals. Now this island-state, uniquely protected by the Taiwan Relations Act passed by US Congress in 1979, is facing a squeeze in multiple directions. The Act does not guarantee the U.S. will intervene militarily if China attacks or invades Taiwan. However, nor does it relinquish it, as its primary purpose is to ensure that US Taiwan policy will not be changed unilaterally and ensure any decision to defend Taiwan will be made with the consent of Congress. The Act states that “the United States will make available to Taiwan such services… as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability”. However, the decision about the nature and quantity of defense services that America will provide to Taiwan is to be determined by the President and Congress. America’s policy has been called “strategic ambiguity”, and it is designed to dissuade Taiwan from unilateral declaration of independence, and China from unilaterally unifying with Taiwan. Nevertheless, the Act is one of the US’s strongest pledges in defense of another state, and a crucial antidote against an “almighty squeeze” from China.In recent years, as China has stepped up military pressure against Taiwan, it is legitimate to ask how far China extends the escalation ladder of coercion? China has options, a record of calculated risk under Xi Jinping, deep concerns regarding the future course of US-Taiwan relations, and a lack of realistic soft alternatives to attract Taiwanese leaders given the rejection of “one country, two systems” in Taiwan. This unique combination of factors makes further escalation likely, but not certain. Nevertheless, Taiwan has maneuvering space to maintain the status quo if it receives sufficient support from the US and other international partners.Since the re-election of Tsai Ing-wen as President of Taiwan in 2020, military pressure has again taken center stage in the Taiwan Strait. China has exerted pressure on Taiwan’s air defense system by conducting circumnavigation flights around the island since Tsai first came to power in 2016. All this makes it imperative that the region be prepared for action from China and that there be renewed communication between Taiwan, Japan and the United States. Taiwan’s renewed communication strategy has offered the island a far greater voice on the world stage to tackle Beijing’s “squeeze”. However, China is also squeezing Taiwan’s international space, including forcing foreign companies to refer to it as being part of China on their websites and executing military drills near the island.Another part of the squeeze of Taiwan is the ban by China on tourist visits to Taiwan, which came into effect in August 2019. China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism cited current cross-Strait tensions when the ban was announced, and the move preceded national elections in Taiwan. Indeed, it was likely a failed attempt to alter the outcome in China’s favor – more specifically, to secure victory for the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)the pandemic has also exposed Taiwan’s exclusion from the global health community. While Taiwan, home to nearly 24 million people, has never been ruled by China’s Communist Party, Beijing’s claims over the island have long blocked it from membership from UN agencies like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). When the WHO issued a world map of the pandemic using color coding to indicate risk, Taiwan was given same level as China, despite Taiwan having a very different (and largely successful) experience with Covid-19.The Beijing government’s real aim is to force unification via an “anaconda strategy” whereby the victim is squeezed until it cannot resist. During the administration of former Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou (2008-–016), this constriction was achieved through a series of agreements described as economic rather than political and off-set by apparent concessions such as Taiwan observer status at the World Health Assembly, that actually relegated Taiwan below that of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Slowly, the pace of the anaconda strategy was stepped up, in across the spectrum moves that included diplomatic, economic, and military efforts as well as attempts to destabilize Taiwan society from within.As seen above, one of the first areas to experience the squeeze was tourism. This was followed by pressure on private foreign businesses. Airlines were ordered to replace their designations of Taipei, Taiwan with Taipei, China, or their landing rights would be cancelled – most complied. In July 2018, the East Asian Olympic Committee rescinded its award to Taichung City to host the East Asian Youth Games due to pressure from China, after the city had already spent tens of millions of dollars in preparations. Only a few weeks before, the Taiwan government had discovered a Chinese project to promote unification in Taoyuan’s public schools. Conversely, there are rewards for foreign citizens and companies who declare fealty to China’s one China policy.Although President Xi Jinping, while addressing the March 2018 meeting of China’s National People’s Congress, warned that Taiwan would face “the punishment of history” for separatism, kinetic military actions thus far have only been intimidatory. However, China has used cyber means and propaganda to influence Taiwan society in increasingly creative ways. Chinese surrogate parties have also engaged in demonstrations on matters unrelated to China policy with the seeming intent of discrediting any initiative of the Tsai administration.While the US has exercised limited military muscle to remind China it still has a presence in the Pacific, a 2020 report from the Brookings Institute has shown that Europe can do more to help Taiwan. Indeed, one of Taiwan’s greatest opportunities to strengthen its standing may be in Europe. Germany, a key player in EU policy discussions on China, announced its first-ever Indo-Pacific strategy in early September. The strategy solidifies Germany’s decision to pursue Asia strategy to contend with China, rather than a China-centered strategy. At the very least, the denser the web of Taiwan’s relations with other countries, the higher the risk and cost Beijing will likely confront should it ever decide to use non-peaceful means in pursuit of its goals.The re-election of Tsai in 2020 with such a resounding vote reflects a steely determination on the part of the Taiwanese to resist the “almighty squeeze” China is seeking to impose on them from across the strait. Reeling from embarrassment about Afghanistan, the Biden administration is unlikely to contemplate any diminution in Congress’s historic support for Taiwan. Therefore, albeit mainly as a result of “strategic ambiguity” Taiwan will continue to have its powerful supporters, and while not able to elude, will confidently shirk off, even China’s latest “almightyReading on E-International RelationsOpinion – Why Tsai Ing-wen’s Victory is a Blessing for the Taiwan StraitA New Page for Taiwan and ChinaOpinion – Omens for US-Taiwan Relations in the Biden AdministrationOpinion – Taiwan Could Be to China What Canada Is to the USThe Implications of the Xi-Ma Meeting for China-Taiwan RelationsCelebrity, Social Media and Disputes Over Taiwan’s SovereigntyAbout The Author(s)Martin Duffy started his career as an international observer in Africa in 1984 and has observed over two hundred elections world-wide.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/12/the-appropriation-of-curiosity/,The Appropriation of ‘Curiosity’,Lorenzo Kamel,Oct 12 2021,"An important historiographical debate developed starting from the 1980s. It was triggered by the publication of a few influential books by British historian Bernard Lewis. The latter argued that “intellectual curiosity” about “other cultures” – and thus the predisposition and will to study languages, history and traditions – is “still peculiar to Western Europe, and to the inheritors and emulators of the European scholarly tradition”. Lewis, who was writing in the very period in which new approaches to global history as well as the subaltern studies project were starting to gain ground, found it natural to claim that it is only with the European Renaissance that “a human society for the first time developed the sophistication, the detachment and, above, all, the curiosity to study and appreciate the literary achievements of alien and even hostile societies”.Over time, these arguments have been echoed by dozens of public intellectuals, many of whom have applied them to specific contests and “cultures”. Franco Cardini, an internationally renowned medievalist and historian of religions, went so far to claim that “disinterest in civilizations other than Islamic ones” is “a characteristic of the culture which emerged from Muhammad’s religious revolution”. Other scholars have framed the same issue in slightly different terms, by placing much emphasis on “the unusual openness of Europeans to learning from other cultures”, while stressing, at the same time, that curiosity became “the trademark of progress itself”.In more recent years, a host of new academic publications have demonstrated, in an increasingly accurate and well-documented manner, how problematic these kinds of approaches are: indeed, every society – from the hunter-gatherers to the largest of the Empires – was in one way or another curious.Roxanne L. Euben’s studies, for instance, supply a wide array of cases on “others’ curiosity” and how they have contributed to “global Europe”.Further examples include the works of Sanjay Subramanyam, – which highlights the dangers of conceiving of “Europe as a deus ex machina” and fosters a global intellectual history which tend to universalize parochial insights – Iraj Omidvar, whose studies aim at “recovering Oriental Perspectives on the West”, and the Lebanese historian Nabīl Matar, who provides a wealth of detail in outlining India’s role and the writings of 17th century Arab travelers expressing their curiosity about the “lands of the Christians” (Bilād al-Nasārā), as well as their ability to appreciate “non-Islamic” concepts and aspects.As Nizar F. Hermes has noted, specifically in relation to the Mediterranean context, “the problem lies more in the Western neglect of the corpus of medieval writings about the Other”. In other words, the limited knowledge of complex “non-colonial languages” and a plethora of manuscripts and documents produced in locations which remain difficult to access, have erroneously led some scholars to emphasize “others’” alleged lack ofthe debate on ‘curiosity’, or the lack of it, can be fully grasped only within a much broader frame which is rooted in the old-new narratives connected to ‘European exceptionalism’.Still today, in fact, plenty of scholars link the key achievements in human history – including, among much else, “critical thinking, freedom of research, experimental science, the secularity of culture and politics, technological inventiveness, the industrial revolution, modernization, capitalism, the autonomy of the individual” – to the influence exerted by “Europe’s knowledge and actions”, and its “leaning toward curiosity”. Others locate the origins of universal concepts, such as the “notion of freedom”, in the “ancient Western world”. The thesis that “there is no doubt that those values [democracy, rule of law and human rights] were born in Europe” is no less widespread.These claims are all rooted, in different forms and ways, to what Peter Burke called “the grand narrative” of the establishment of Western civilization, specifically a triumphalist account of Western achievement from the Greeks onwards in which the Renaissance is a link in a chain which includes the Reformation, the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and so on. Each of these historical periods has been (and still is) often presented as a moral success story, as well as by juxtaposing an alleged European pro-activeness to a supposedly intrinsic “Eastern” passivity.What is largely missing in these types of approaches are the structural contributions of the “others”. Take, for instance, the case of the debates around democracy, and the related and largely successful attempt to detach ancient Greece’s legacy from its Mediterranean and ‘oriental’ background. In Ellen Meiksins Wood’s words, “it is even more artificial to detach ancient Greece from, say, Egypt or Persia, as if the Greeks were always ‘European’, living a separate history, and not part of a larger Mediterranean and ‘Eastern’ world”.Think of symbols such as the myrtle dedicated to the Goddess Aphrodite and Athena’s olive tree, both borrowed from the traditions of ancient Egypt. In other words, scholars who link Europe’s roots to Ancient Greece, and thus to many of the previously mentioned concepts and ideas, are simply (more or less consciously) recognizing Europe’s oriental connections (in Greek mythology, Europe is the name of the daughter of Agenor’s, king of Tyre, in modern-day Lebanon), dominant religion (Christianity was an Oriental religion), and philosophical roots.The term φιλόσοφος (philosophos) itself, “lover of wisdom”, is drawn from the Egyptian mer-rekh (mr-rḫ), “lover of knowledge”. The most ancient philosophical texts originate precisely from ancient Egypt, beginning with the papyrus on the “Immortality of writers”, (re)discovered in the 1920s and dated 1200 BCE.The invention of a “Judeo-Christian tradition”The considerations highlighted so far are also caught up with the misleading view frequently referred to as the “Western Judeo-Christian tradition”. The latter paradigm denies the large entanglement between Judeo-Christian-Muslim faiths, and overshadows the millenary history which predated them. Still today, plenty of scholars habitually refer to a supposed Judeo-Christian tradition as “the cradle of principles of equality and justice”, while others focus on “democracy’s biblical roots” and, more generally, the role of Biblical texts in fostering secular political power and its desacralization. In this case as well, however, such assumptions reflect limited, simplistic, and frequently anachronistic perspectives.Indeed, atheism, as well as some principles related to secularism, were introduced into Indian traditions long before being introduced in Europe. Even more important within the frame of this article is the fact that, in the words of the American Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg, “‘Judeo-Christian” isn’t a thing. It a) positions Jews & Christians against Muslims, is Islamophobic b) elides Christian oppression & murder of Jews over more than 1000 years & c) ignores Jewish civilization worldwide & facts of key Jewish developments in Middle East & N[orth]addition to being misleading, the widespread tendency to refer to a “Western Jewish-Christian tradition” risks accentuating dangerous antagonisms and “watershed” phenomena at the expense of a greater understanding of the shared historical legacy underlying the three largest mono-theistic religions. A powerful confirmation of this fact can be seen in the Epic of Gilgamesh (c. 2100), a literary product of ancient Mesopotamia, the cradle of Sumerians, to whom we owe, among many other inventions, cheques, letters of credit, and interest payments on loans. The Epic contains many of the themes – including the myth of the “universal flood”, Noah’s Ark, the Garden of Eden – that were later included in the Bible and other religious texts.What is has just been argued applies to many other related issues as well. Think, for instance, of the literary parallelisms of the Song of Songs, that is, compositions of similar topics that existed previously in ancient Egyptian and Sumerian literature: “The love song genre”, as noted by Michael V. Fox, “certainly underwent many changes between its presumed Egyptian origins and the time when it reached Palestine, took root in Hebrew literature, grew in native forms, and blossomed as the song of songs”. To remain in the field of literature, it should be noted, incidentally, that 14th-century BCE Mesopotamia was the birthplace of the first poetess in history: the Sumerian priestess Enheduanna.A further significant example can be found in the ‘holy city’ par excellence, Jerusalem. As noted in a study published by the University of Bar-Ilan, “Canaanite Jerusalem had two holy sites; both were above and outside the city walls. Shalem was probably worshipped in the area of the Temple Mount, which later became the holiest site for the Jews and the third most holy site for Moslems”.The idea of the rosary itself was borrowed from Muslims in Spain, who were inspired by the prayer beads Buddhists used in Central Asia, who in turn borrowed the idea from Brahmans in Hindu India. Even Christianity underwent continuous contamination as it expanded from the Eastern Mediterranean to Europe: during this process, it took on numerous spatio-architectural practices, – such as the “Gothic style”, adopted to build many cathedrals in Europe (but also castles, palaces, and town halls) – and cultural customs, including traditions typical of pre-Christian Europe that form the basis of some key aspects of the Christmas and Easter holidays. Like all the themes and aspects mentioned in this article, religions are thus the result of human ‘accumulation’: a process which is not always understood in all its complexity and potential.Health and rightsTwo other aspects have played a particularly relevant role in the development of humankind and represent key elements within the frame of ‘entanglements’: health and rights.It was above all the ancient Egyptians and Indians, and later some Persian, Chinese and Arab luminaries, who invented – or played a key role in introducing – practices such as anesthesia, bloodletting, and plastic surgery (Alexander the Great was responsible for importing the ancient Indian Sanskrit texts dedicated to early techniques for ear, nose and lip reconstruction into Europe), as well as plenty of surgical techniques and the first medical diagnoses for hundreds of diseases such as smallpox, measles and Parkinson’s.Chinese doctors were the first to develop rudimentary vaccines and it was a Chinese author, Wan Quan (1499-1582), the first historical figure to clearly refer to the practice of vaccination by inoculation: the year was 1549 and Wan Quan was intent on highlighting efforts to combat the scourge of smallpox. It is worth recalling that inoculation was not practiced outside of China, India, Turkey and other “eastern countries” until the 18thmedieval hospitals in Iraq and several other Islamic majority countries pioneered the practice of dividing hospitalization into different sections, based on the diseases that the patients were suffering from. It should also be remembered the role played by figures such as the Persian scientist Zakariyyā al-Rāzī (the first doctor to understand the function of fever, discover allergic asthma and describe diseases such as smallpox, at the end of the 9th century), the Basra-based physicist ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham (who founded modern optics at the beginning of the 11th century), the Syrian physician ʿAlī ibn ʿĪsā al-Kahhāl (the first to prescribe an anesthetic for surgical purposes and produce an illustration of optic chiasm and the brain, around the year 1000), the scholar Ibn al-Nafīs from Damascus (considered “the father of circulatory physiology”), and the Turkish physicist Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu (author of the first surgical atlas). These and many other examples show that the field of modern medicine, like all others mentioned so far, owes its development to a long process of ‘accumulation’, within which European physicians have largely played the role of beneficiaries, and much less the one of contributors.The question of health and safeguarding health is closely intertwined with the defense of human rights, that is, the inalienable rights that every human being possesses. Contrary to what is commonly asserted, the recognition of these rights is by no means a “product of Europe”, “the West”, or the Enlightenment.In the words of Indian jurist Upendra Baxi, “the dominant discourse presents the very notion of human rights as ‘the gift of the West to the Rest’”. The latter is a meta-narrative that, among other side effects, fosters a sort of ‘collective amnesia’: “The ‘Enlightenment’ epoch that gave birth to the liberal ‘modern’ notions of human rights […] in effect, globalized extraordinarily cruel practices of Social Darwinism”.It should also be clarified that the issue of human rights is rooted in a much earlier past than the one Baxi analyzes. Indeed, the first known historical figure to address the issue was the Persian Emperor Cyrus the Great (590 BCE-530 BCE). His decrees were engraved, in Akkadic cuneiform characters, on a baked clay cylinder known as the Cyrus Cylinder: this represents the world’s first document about human rights. The principle of ‘human rights’ spread from Babylon primarily to India. In the latter, the concept of human rights and the protecting of such rights are not seen in any way as ‘Western’; rather, they are perceived as principles embedded in Indian culture since the dawn of time.This argument neither erases nor diminishes the fact that the Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628), the Constitution of the United States (1787), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) and the United States’ Bill of Rights (1791) are documents with epochal scope and value. They have been highly influential in the process of asserting individual rights, albeit for a very limited group of human beings (the wealthy and/or powerful).Nevertheless, the common approach of identifying the Magna Carta as the starting point in the process of recognizing human rights is tantamount to framing the “City of Three Monotheisms” (Jerusalem) in 1000 BCE as the beginning of human history (an equally common approach). In reality, just as the “Holy City par excellence” had already experienced 2000 years of history when it was conquered by King David (1010 BCE), so many of the principles contained in the Magna Carta belonged to a larger ‘human history’ that had developed in places quite distant from the supposed “cradle of the rule of law” (England) and conceived in times much older than modernity alone.In addition, all the above-mentioned declarations and constitutions were addressed to only a small subsection of the inhabitants and, in later times, of the citizens. The Magna Carta, for example, was conceived for the exclusive benefit of “free men”, to the detriment of the “servants” who accounted for nearly all of England’ s population at the time. For centuries, as confirmed by the spread of slavery, the right to property – which, in various forms, have existed in South Asia and other world areas since the ‘Early Middle Ages’ – was believed to have priority over the rights of humanmight be rightly argued that it was only with the United Nations (1948) – within which, beside Western countries, also a number of Asian, African, and Middle Eastern diplomats provided significant contributions – and, later on, the Council of Europe (1949), that tools and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the universal protection of human rights were enacted: the attempt to achieve such ‘universality’ represented indeed an unprecedented step in world history. And yet, only a limited number of academic studies have dealt with the role played by international human rights in legitimizing and reproducing existing relations of dominations.Even less are the studies which have discussed the link between white supremacy and the process which brought to the introduction of the concept of ‘human rights’ into the UN Charter. Last but not least, that very same tools and monitoring mechanisms were adopted right after the bloodiest and most devastating war in human history, a “European war”[1] which became a world, or global, conflict only at a later stage.Ultimately, the misunderstood authorship discourse of human rights is embedded in a solipsistic approach that still today often confounds and overlaps a simplified perception of the ‘history of the West’ with a more complex, ongoing ‘human journey’.ConclusionsEach of the aspects addressed in this article reminds us of the need to support the mainstreaming of a more syncretic (in the original ancient Persian meaning of the term), ‘cross-pollinating’, and entangled knowledge, which will be able to place also the ‘others’ – with their ‘curiosities’ and contributions – at the center stage, to better understand ‘ourselves’ and the fluid world which we inhabit.How to do so? By opposing any form of “epistemic violence”, – that is the process by which the non-Western peoples are viewed as passive, weak and disinterested – while at the same time enabling the retrieval of different ways of knowing and a wider understanding the “epistemologies of the South”; by deconstructing and tackling the assumption “that the West represents the center of scholarship and the rest (usually Africa, Asia, and Latin America) fits the margin”; by involving – in line with the ongoing “Why is My Curriculum White” campaign – a larger number of non-Western faculty from institutions around the world; by investing more in “denationalized curricula”, occluded and marginalized knowledges, and academic positions which foster indigenous approaches.All this requires, first and foremost, intellectual flexibility and the will to question long-established scholarly traditions. It also demands a process of ‘unlearning’ the way in which history – and particularly the one linked to intellectual curiosity – continues to be (often) taught and learnt. It is indeed necessary to unlearn in order to relearn, to deconstruct in order to reconstruct. In Susan Buck-Morss’ words: “The greater the specialization of knowledge, the more advanced the level of research, the longer and more venerable the scholarly tradition, the easier it is to ignore discordant facts”.Note[1] Center for Asia Minor Studies (CAMS) – KP 350, p. 94.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/12/opinion-a-state-of-emergency-at-the-polish-belarusian-border/,Opinion – A State of Emergency at the Polish-Belarusian Border,Monika Kabata,Oct 12 2021,"A small Polish village on the border with Belarus, Usnarz Górny, has become a symbol of the Polish stand on refugees’ protection as 32 asylum seekers became trapped between Polish and Belarusian border guards. Polish authorities not only refuse to accept their asylum applications and are building a barbed wire fence but also, on September 2, 2021, declared a state of emergency in 183 towns in a 3-kilometer strip of land along the Polish-Belarusian border. In their opinion, the current situation is a hybrid attack orchestrated by Lukashenko who tries to destabilize the political situation in Poland by bringing migrants from Iraq to the Polish border. However, the situation in Usnarz Górny is only the tip of the iceberg as migration from the Eastern border has been increasing already for some time as well as the number of push back operations.A similar stand on the matter was taken by the EU, as the European Commissioner for Home Affairs, Ylva Johansson, claimed:“This area between the Poland and #Belarus borders is not a migration issue, but part of the aggression of Lukashenko toward Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, with the aim to destabilize the E.U”.My interview with @StevenErlanger Bxl correspondent @nytimes https://t.co/nl90B9nchK— Ylva Johansson (@YlvaJohansson) August 27, 2021 The actions on Polish side, the state of emergency and the lack of access to the border zone, already led to death of six people who tried to cross the border – causing concern in the European Commission. But why has this situation has not met yet with a harsh criticism and actions from the EU institutions? This article looks at some reasons of why Poland and the EU behave in this way. It starts however with the question why Poland must help asylum seekers.First and foremost, push-back operations are illegal and the refusal to accept and examine asylum applications is against the Geneva Convention, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Dublin Convention. If an individual expresses a claim for asylum, the border guard has a legal obligation to examine it. However, according to the work of The Rule of Law Institute, border guards take advantage of terminological differences. Asylum seekers often use the word ‘azyl’ which is very similar to English (‘asylum’) and should be understood, in accordance with the EU terminology, as a request for international protection. Nevertheless, Polish border guards use Polish terminology according to which ‘azyl’ is a national form of protection (not international protection) granted to foreigners in need of protection but when it is supported by the interests of Poland. In the case of lack of such interest, protection is not granted.Another example of unlawful actions towards asylum seekers is included in a draft act amending the act on foreigners and the act on granting protection to foreigners within the territory of the Republic of Poland – adopted on August 17, 2021. According to the act, foreigners may be immediately removed and banned from re-entering Poland in case of illegal border crossing. Additionally, their applications for international protection may be left without examination, which has been claimed to be against not only the provisions of international law but also the PolishKaczynski, current vice-president and leader of the Law and Justice Party, made a speech in the Parliament on September 16, 2015, arguing that Poland does not have a moral obligation to accept refugees as it neither took part in colonialization nor in the recent destabilising actions taken by the US and some European countries in the Middle East. Whereas indeed Poland did not have colonies, it does take advantage of being part of a system build by previous colonizers. Moreover, Poland sent troops to Afghanistan and Iraq which are two countries from which many asylum seekers come. Further, from the historical point of view, Poland should express a special empathy and solidarity with foreigners who not only flee from wars and persecution but also seek to find a better life as Polish history includes several waves of emigration.Poland needs foreigners for at least two reasons: cultural and economic. Although the number of foreigners in Poland has significantly increased, it still contrasts with the data from other European countries: on January 1, 2020, Poland had the second lowest (after Romania) share of non-nationals in the resident population in the EU. In a survey from the same year, only 40% of Poles declared that they personally knew a foreigner living in Poland. This lack of familiarity with foreigners can significantly contribute to a hostile attitude towards foreigners, especially to those from the Middle East and Africa, and lead to tensions in the society when the flow of immigrants increases. And this will likely happen due to the demographical situation: Polish society is lately eldering faster than the average in the EU and it is calculated that “in 2030 employers will have problems with filling every fifth job position”.During the ‘migration crisis’ the Polish Government took a firm stand on migration which still has repercussions. The refusal to relocate a relatively small number of refugees impacted both the internal and external image of Poland. On one hand, the Polish Government adopted securitising discourse on migration, presenting especially people from the Middle East and Africa, as a serious threat to national, societal and health security. Accepting refugees now would contradict this discourse as well as the above-mentioned discourse on lack of moral obligation to help. Thus, the actions that are currently under way are in line with the representation of Poland as a country that prioritises its security and defence – in this case, from Belarusian attack.While the Polish government’s actions met with strong opposition from legal experts, activists and some politicians, the supporting response that came from the EU can be seen as unexpected at the first sight. Nevertheless, the EU still very much remembers the lack of solidarity among the Member States in 2015 and it faces unsolved problems at other migration routes and fears for future blackmail with migrants as a bargaining chip as in the case of Turkey. If one assumes that the increase of the number of migrants at the Polish Eastern border is indeed just Lukashenko’s doing, then taking the refugees opens the door for future blackmail not only from Belarus but also other countries – and this says nothing for the humanitarian cost.Finally, there are also technical problems to consider. First, as it has been suspected by the Rule of Law Institute, Polish border guards may have problems with access Eurodac devices which makes it impossible to effectively scan fingerprints with the submission of the asylum application as required by the Dublin Convention. Second, there is a lack of places in the centres for foreigners. Since migration to Poland has generally increased and the admission of applications at legal crossings has been limited, the number of irregular crossings rose significantly: in the first half of this year, there were 4006 persons, whereas in the same period of the previous year – 1453. If someone crosses the border irregularly then they are automatically sent to one of only six centres in Poland. There is also an issue with translators whose presence is essential. Lack of translators slows down the process and causes asylum seekers to spend months waiting for decisions in the guarded centres without knowing what is happening with theirthe technical issues with accepting asylum seekers in Poland as well as the difficult situation across the EU in migration matters can to some extent explain the impasse at the border, can politics and technicalities be above the right to international protection, and especially, humanitarian treatment? Poland has been disobeying its obligations towards asylum seekers for a long time and this should be condemned at the international stage. The problem is that neither the EU nor the world has a long-term plan for how to manage migration which can only be expected to increase due to political destabilisation and climate crisis.The author would like to thank dr Tomasz Sieniow, the President of the Rule of Law Foundation, for a very interesting discussion, and insights, that contributed to this article.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/11/opinion-anti-blackness-a-go-to-foreign-policy/,Opinion – Anti-Blackness: A Go-to Foreign Policy?,Christiane Ndedi Essombe,Oct 11 2021,"As nearly ten thousand of migrating people, predominantly from Haiti, sought to enter the United States by land, a picture of a White police agent on a horseback unleashing his whip at a Black man, made its rounds on the internet. Labeled as “grim echoes of history” by some, the picture can easily (re)trigger generational trauma in those who share the same skin color as the man the border agent was firmly grabbing by his shirt. A generational trauma that cannot possibly be healed so long as Black people are constantly exposed to violence against their very existence and expected to normalize it.Pictures of a White border agent on a horseback in the southern state of Texas enforcing state policies by whipping a Black man, is troubling when one understands the historical context.Such a scene echoes one of the earliest forms of policing in the United States: slave patrols. Slave patrols were composed of White men aged between 25 and 45, mostly from the South of the US, entrusted with the responsibility to oversee and control the movements of enslaved Black people. This included violently intercepting any enslaved person found outside of a plantation.Just like the border agent photographed, they were mounted on horsebacks with a whip as their weapon of choice. Specifically, they were to “arrest any slave or slaves whether with or without a permit […]. Which slave or slaves thus arrested shall be subjected to corporal punishment not exceeding 30 stripes.” Commenting on the photograph widely shared, White House spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, expressed that she “can’t imagine what context would make that appropriate”. History indicates that the very fabric of policing in Americawould frame such actions as appropriate.It is not the first time in recent years that migrating people, predominantly from Haiti, are mistreated at the border between the US and Mexico. In 2015, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced an extension of the temporary status of protection (TPS) granted to Haitian citizens due to the humanitarian crisis that unfolded following the 2010 earthquake. Thousands of Haitian individuals embarked on an extremely perilous journey across south and central America to exercise their human right to seek asylum. Instead, as more people from Haiti arrived at the US southern border, the DHS decided to resume deportations of Haitians a year earlier than first announced. For migrating people this resulted in a lot of incertitude and longer wait times in precarious conditions. Indeed, Haitian migrants were first forced to wait in makeshift camps and underfunded shelters on the Mexican side of the border. Then, after formally entering the US, they were to wait in jail while their claim was processed based on criteria that were unknown to many claimants themselves. Five years later, it appears that conditions still fail to protect basic dignity and human rights, poignantly happening in a government that advances more favourable immigration policies.Even at home Haitians face foreign policies steeped in anti-blackness. Once an island split between French rule on the west and Spanish rule on the east, Haiti became the first and only colony of enslaved people to successfully overthrow the French empire. It even controlled its neighbour, the Dominican Republic for a generation. Despite this prowess, the country is now subject to racist policies from the same neighbour which are colloquially refer to as anti-haitianismo. This includes an amendment in the Dominican constitution to strip citizenship from any Dominican of Haitian descent and overall a political project to reject any affiliation to Africa and Black people. In its most brutal moments, this project has resulted in the execution of thousands of Haitian people and Dominicans of Haitian ancestry in 1937.Across the globe, Black people – that is people with black skin, or at least perceived as such – face varying degrees of violence and violations of human rights, particularly when seeking to claim what should be human rights for all. That dichotomy between rights that theoretically apply to all yet are denied to some, is maybe where the main issue lies: Black people are still not seen as fully deserving of human rights. The US border agent’s decision to incorporate whipping into his duties, a practice usually observed among some pastoralists and their animals (although also challenged in that context), actually speaks very loudly to the ongoing dehumanization of Black people and black bodies. This ideology is not new and is the corner stone of the Enlightenment era and pseudo-scientific attempts to associate skin color with intellect, morality, skills and therefore, humanity.In hindsight it is (hopefully) now obvious that these false correlations were only subterfuges to normalize chattel slavery and genocide against Indigenous peoples of the Americas. Yet, the very philosophers who normalized a hierarchy of biological races with White people at the top and Black people at the bottom such as Kante, Hume and Voltaire to name a few, remain celebrated. It is therefore no surprise that their ideology has remained unchallenged and continue to permeate foreign policies, consciously or not, particularly as it relates to interactions with blackcould be argued that the Berlin conference of 1888 was a European foreign policy and that it paradoxically embodied disdain toward Black people, and a love for their natural resources. In a sense, the conference was a virtual whip whose lashes still hurt to this day, dividing and spreading Africans with no regard for their culture, history, rights to humanity or agency in decisions about their resources and identity.Centuries later, as thousands of migrating people are left to die in the Mediterranean, as laws ignoring their human rights – such as erecting barbed wires with blades in Melilla and blocking rescue boats – continue to be approved, and as a head of state confidently qualified Haiti and African countries as “sh-tholes”, the European Union and the United States continue to present themselves as expert advocates for human rights. The only way that dissonance can exist is if, as mentioned before, non-White people – and specifically Black people – are still seen as less deserving of human rights. It is only on that ground that the historical violation of their human rights can be comfortably overlooked when assessing countries and their compliance with the human rights framework.As can only be the case with any phenomenon tied to colonialism, anti-Blackness is global and therefore anti-Blackness in foreign policy is not limited to Europe and North America. In 2020, as the global pandemic was in its early days, citizens of African countries in China were forcibly tested for COVID-19, forbidden to enter shops, evicted from their apartment and forced to sleep in the street. The fact that many African nationals had negative test results or had not travelled was not seen as relevant in the enforcement of these measures. Researchers reported that “other foreign groups have generally not been subjected to similar treatment.”Interestingly, at the height of the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis, many Africans in non-African countries also saw their rights violated regardless of whether they had been exposed to the Ebola virus. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, although African ambassadors in Beijing as well as Ghana’s and Kenya’s respective foreign minister – among others – “shared concerns”, in practice not much was done. Some government representatives from China denied the claims and both parts seemingly had a case of selective amnesia. African countries then moved on to wait for COVID vaccines that are yet to be received. Nineteen months into the pandemic Africa is currently the least vaccinated continent and projected to be the last to reach herd immunity. Examples of anti-Blackness in foreign policies truly abound.As anti-Blackness and its normalization are present through time and space, one can wonder to what extent Black people themselves have also normalized anti-Blackness. Unsurprisingly, anti-Blackness in foreign policies can also be found in African countries, whether that is in the almost inexistant intra-African trade or in unnecessarily burdensome visa requirements for Africans seeking to visit other African countries. The list of manifestations of anti-Blackness in foreign policies, past and present, is long. The list of measures taken by predominantly Black countries to counter these measures is way shorter, to not say inexistent.As the 76th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) takes place in New York, Haiti Prime Minister Ariel Henry referred to the right of sovereign countries to administer their border. He also tied migration to unending inequality and noted that countries that are now wealthy were once built by migrants.South Africa’s Cyril Ramaphosa highlighted among others the responsibility to fight the legacy of racism. With such a premise it is unfortunate that no one explicitly connected these two points to position racism as a race-based system of subordination that violates human rights to provide free or cheap labour and generate wealth for the socio-economic elite. History will tell whether any tangible change to seriously tackle racism and inequality can be observed following this 76th UN General Assembly. If the last centuries are of any indication, as long as predominantly Black countries themselves do not name, acknowledge and challenge anti-Blackness within their societies and in western quarters, nothing willReading on E-International RelationsOpinion – Bolsonaro’s Foreign Policy is Typically Latin AmericanHigher Education and Race Relations in BrazilThe Impact of White Supremacy on US Foreign Policy towards AfricaForeign Policy in the KitchenUS and British Foreign Policy from One Regime Change to AnotherTheories of Foreign Policy and International RelationsAbout The Author(s)Christiane Ndedi Essombe holds a Master of Public Health (MPH) from the University of Montreal.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/09/opinion-georgias-democracy-still-in-peril/,Opinion – Georgia’s Democracy Still in Peril,Martin Duffy,Oct 9 2021,"When arriving in the Georgian capital, one is immediately stuck by echoes of the Cold War. Communist era nostalgia is redolent on Tblisi’s beautiful streets. The ghost of Stalin seems to percolate the air. Poised in the maelstrom of historic territorial rivalry, Georgia suffers the collective pains of Russia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, as if it did not have crises enough of its own. War in Abkhazia and in South Ossetia are overwhelming for any post-Soviet state, but in the Georgian case they are compounded by ongoing conflicts among neighboring territories. Unavoidably, Georgian democracy is imperiled by ‘forever wars’ internally and along its international boundaries.The escalation of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan proves that a frozen conflict can surface abruptly and intensify apace. Nagorno-Karabakh has an intense ethnic and territorial conflict between Armeniaand Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh (Mostly ethnic Armenian) and numerous traditionally Azerbaijani neighborhoods. These latter zones are under the Republic of Artsakh, but are internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory. It is an old conflict but erupted in modern form in 1988 in the demand these lands join Armenia. War was only narrowly averted in 2020.In terms of big power play, while Russia has historically backed Armenia with military bases on Armenian soil, it also soothed Azerbaijan by simultaneously arming Baku. As we will see later, enemies’ friends and friend’s enemies can appear confused in the Caucasus. Turkey openly bolsters Azerbaijan as evidenced by its increasing military exports to Baku. Georgia has maintained close ties and neighborly relations with both countries, keeping a neutral position when it comes to military escalation. Georgia is in something of a quandary when it comes to taking a stand on the cauldron of conflict around it. Russia, illegally occupies 20% of Georgia’s territory, so can hardly be considered a friend.Indeed, the bullying posture from the Kremlin makes keeping peaceful relations with its other neighbors of vital importance, geopolitically and economically. Tbilisi has adopted a proactive approach to its regional relations by signaling to its neighbors its willingness to become a mediator in the ongoing conflict. While Tbilisi’s offer to play the role of a mediator has not been taken up by the conflicting sides, the approach is probably prudent even while Georgia was targeted with disinformation campaigns discrediting Tbilisi’s neutrality. Tblisi certainly has to do something to neutralize the threat from Russia and has toyed at different times with both obvious diplomatic concepts, recognizing, “the enemy’s enemy is our friend” and almost symmetrically, acknowledging, “the enemy’s friend is our friend too”. Neither tactic has been entirely effective.Georgia has significant ethnic Armenian and Azerbaijani minorities and these current tensions have the potential to radicalize ethnic minorities and cause atavistic clashes. This places Russia in a favorable position, as historically the Kremlin has been effective at exploiting ethnic tensions to bolster its own power-base. Thus, in the midst of chaos in the Caucasus, ethnic divisions may be yet another opportunity for the Kremlin to seek to further destabilize the internal political situation in Georgia. That is the context to the upcoming local elections in Georgia. Following an invitation from the authorities of Georgia and in accordance with its mandate, ODIHR has deployed an Election Observation Mission (EOM) for 2 October 2021 local elections. The ODIHR EOM will assess the elections for their compliance with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards, as well as with national legislation, including post-election developments. Specific aspects include the implementation of the amended legal framework, candidate registration, the campaign, election dispute resolution and election media coverage. They will also assess how prior ODIHR election related recommendations were considered. As part of the observation, the ODIHR EOM will conduct comprehensive monitoring of thethe elections of 31 October and 21 November 2020, the ruling Georgian Dream party under Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia won re-election for a third term in office, making it the first party in Georgian history to achieve a 3rd term. The election also saw a record number of opposition parties elected to parliament. However, the opposition parties boycotted the second round of the elections and called on voters to abstain. The turnout in the second round fell to a mere 26.29%, raising questions about credibility.The Georgian parliament passed further electoral reforms; however, the ultimate constitutional changes came from OSCE-ODIHR suggestions to the existing electoral code rather than the negotiations between the government and opposition . These include the regulation of election ads, the involvement of non-government entities in the electoral process, the regulation of the publication of opinion polls, and introducing a gender quota of 25%. The quota will probably remain intact till 2028 . The US embassy has enthusiastically praised the reforms, though voiced concerns over the remaining gaps in the electoral legislation, including lack of transparency in selecting Election Commission Members, dispute resolution mechanisms, voter intimidation and providing for suitable and safe alternative channels to campaign during the COVID-19 pandemic . In all of these deliverables, parliament failed.During the 2020 Parliamentary Elections, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly stated that “elections were competitive”, while also reported “pervasive allegations of pressure on voters and blurring of the line between the ruling party and the state”. The United States embassy in Georgia, commenting on the OSCE statement, said: “We call on all parties to address these deficiencies in advance of the second round and in future elections. These efforts to corrupt the electoral process through voter intimidation, vote buying, interfering with ballot secrecy, blurring of party and official activities, and violence against election observers and journalists, while not sufficient to invalidate the results, continue to mar Georgia’s electoral process and are unacceptable”.After the first round, public protests were held in Tbilisi, with almost 50,000 people attending a near-riot situation on 8 November that was eventually broken up with water cannons. Eight opposition parties subsequently announced they would not attend parliament. On 3 November 2020, all Georgian opposition parties signed a joint statement renouncing their seats in the parliament until the parliamentary elections (which they consider null and void) are repeated . Georgian democracy is genuinely in peril.As Thomas De Waal has written,For Georgia’s ruling party, regime survival seems to trump all other considerations. Georgian Dream’s fight with Western partners and persistent political polarization risk undoing the country’s democratic progress.Georgia does not have the scale of human tragedy we see in the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict nor the absolute oppression of President Alexander Lukashenko’s Belarus. But Georgia’s long-accumulated achievements in building something approaching a democratic state are now in danger of “suffering death by a thousand cuts”.The Georgian Dream ruling party is in a fight with the EU and the United States. The country’s leaders also quarreled with Western partners over the Tbilisi Pride march in July. On July 5, they failed to protect journalists from violence by anti-LGBTQ extremists, who ripped the EU flag from parliament buildings. Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili dubbed the event a “propagandistic parade,” attacking the EU as a liberal hegemon imposing its values on the unwilling Georgian nation. However, as Nino Lejava has written in Carnegie Europe’s Future of Georgia project; looking at divisions in Georgian society, Georgian elites’ pro-European platform is generally more about geopolitical protection than signing up to common values.Georgia’s instability is not just down to the machinations of the Georgian Dream Party. There is a constant tinderbox of trouble between the country’s main opposition grouping, and former ruling party, the United National Movement (UNM), led from exile by ex-president Mikheil Saakashvili. While in office, Saakashvili was hardly any less free of corrupt practices, but they now accuse Georgian Dream of large-scale corruption –of politicizing the judiciary, suppressing independent media, and openly harassing opposition candidates. These claims may be somewhat exaggerated. Moreover, both sides have an abundance of corruption allegations towanted a boycott of the new parliament following the 2020 elections. Eventually it required an international mediator to negotiate a compromise between these irreconcilable political forces. European Council president Charles Michel struck a compromise by which Georgian Dream agreed to hold early parliamentary elections if it received less than 43 percent in the municipal elections scheduled for October 2, 2021. Smaller opposition parties signed the agreement, but the UNM did not, leading the ruling party to complain it was making unilateral concessions and getting nothing in return. Some continue to interpret Georgian politics in starkly geopolitical terms, always seeing the hand of Moscow looming around. However, it is worth noting that the Georgian Dream government remains sympathetic towards the EU and NATO, which still commands strong public support. Russia has had no formal diplomatic relations with Georgia since the 2008 war and that is unlikely to change so long as the perpetual stand-off over Abkhazia and South Ossetia continues.Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov could not miss an opportunity to comment on events and say that the door was open to Georgia for better relations, but he offered no path to make that a reality. Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili and Garibashvili are not so much emulating Russia, as the transactional relationship Georgia’s other neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey, have with Western countries. Saakashvili has allied with Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and even invited him to Georgia in 2012. Indeed, regime survival seems to trump all other considerations – even macro-financial aid. In so much as Garibashvili and his masters have strategy, it seems to involve all the following. First, controlling the media, judiciary, and elections. Second, wooing the public with talk of “Georgian values” and a morbid fear of Saakashvili to distract them from other issues. Third, preserve reasonably good working relations with both Washington and Brussels, while not burning all its political bridges with Moscow.It is hard to judge how far the Georgian people buy this message. The National Democratic Institute survey from July 2021 makes for sobering reading. In this survey, fifty one percent of respondents said that “Georgia is not a democracy”. There is widespread political discontent and profound lack of confidence in political institutions. Indeed, in the NDI report, a mere 30 percent, “named a political party they would vote for”. Unemployment and welfare are still not addressed and that seems to undermine the soft words of Georgian politicians of any hue. In the upcoming local elections, it is encouraging that there are a good many independent candidates. The incumbent, Georgian Dream’s Kakha Kaladze, is the favorite to win. But if the independents do well, then we can at least say that “reports of the death of Georgian democracy are a bit exaggerated”.Independents (however) are quick to point out that the existing majoritarian-style system of government makes it impossible for them to exercise power in parliament and accuse Russia-made billionaire and, briefly, Georgia’s prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, of running a shadow government . Any party running on a pro-Russia platform in Georgia is likely to be dead on arrival – especially since Russia invaded the country in 2008 and still illegally occupies 20 percent of its territory. But there have also been accusations of shadowy ties between Ivanishvili and the Kremlin. The truth is sometimes stranger than fiction.Since independence, Georgia has experienced a meteoric ascent from a war-torn, post-Soviet Union backwater to a relative metamorphosis as a regional model of democratic institution-building and integration with the West. A small Caucasus nation of less than 4 million people that could once hardly supply its citizens with daily power and water, is now aspiring to NATO and EU membership. Georgia has come far since it elected its first president, the pro-Western Zviad Gamsakhurdia, in 1991, who was deposed in a violent coup amid a two-year civil war, and replaced by his archrival Eduard Shevardnadze, whose eight years in power, from 1995 to 2003, were scandalized with rampant ill-disguised corruption and economic and politicalforced Shevardnadze ignominiously out of office in 2003 after massive electoral violations. They then embraced Mikheil Saakashvili who inclined Georgia toward the West but stumbled into all-out conflict with Russia in 2008. He was forced out of office in 2012 and convicted of abuse of power in absentia, but that in itself rather shows an improvement in Georgian conceptions of governance. Perhaps what Georgia genuinely needs is coalition rule. Certainly, civil society leaders and opposition parties warn Georgians are growing tired of the power struggles. Georgia’s stability is vital to the safeguarding of the entire region, and yet its political leaders lack the sincerity of democratic commitment required to take a leap of political faith. One side is still seeking only to lock the other out, when the political nomenclature of Georgia cries out for some kind of coalition-building.While Georgia’s ruling party Georgian Dream secured a convincing victory in October local elections that were widely seen as a referendum on the current authorities, this will not produce a government. The next elections in a month’s time will struggle even to do that. Moreover, the arrest of former president Mikheil Saakashvili shows that political tensions will go on. According to an EU-brokered agreement reached in April 2021 that aimed to resolve Georgia’s long-running political crisis, early parliamentary elections would be called for 2022 if Georgian Dream failed to secure at least 43% of the vote in Saturday’s local elections. Based on preliminary results from the country’s Central Election Commission, Georgian Dream comfortably passed this threshold with 46.7% of votes. However, a 2nd round will be necessary and may not even then be decisive.Saakashvili’s arrest has sparked international concern and looks set to deepen domestic divides within Georgian society as the country braces for a series of second round run-off votes in major cities including Tbilisi. Local elections were a chance to demonstrate a new Georgian democratic spirit but did the exact opposite. The verdict of the OSCE/ODIHR team was clear but nuanced. While not claiming the vote was invalid, it noted numerous flaws such as “widespread and consistent allegations of intimidation, vote-buying, pressure on candidates and voters, and an unlevel playing field.” These are all uppermost in the international observers “tool-kit” of metaphors of circumspection. Also, while noting that “the legal framework is generally conducive to democratic elections and preparations for the elections were transparent and professionally managed,” it complained about “intimidation and violence against journalists” and “significant imbalance in resources, insufficient oversight of campaign finances and an undue advantage of incumbency”. While recognizing the “orderly and transparent” conduct of the elections, the OSCE/ODIHR team also pointed to abuses such as “groups of individuals potentially influencing voters outside some polling stations.” Claims of fraud were made by Georgian Dream, UNM, and other parties.It seems unlikely that a month will generate a new reconciliation spirit for coalition-building and that most likely Georgia’s politicians will engage in another dogfight over the corpse of a tentative democracy.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/10/02/visa-policies-as-externalisation-practices-in-the-global-south/,Visa Policies as Externalisation Practices in the Global South,Natalia Cintra,Oct 2 2021,"Whenever the topic of externalisation of borders comes up, it hardly ever refers to Global South borders. Most analysis on externalisation involve Global North’s countries attempts to move their migration controls further away, particularly to Global South’s territories, as is the case of Turkey, Libya, Mexico, Guatemala and Nauru, to name a few. This reiterates a long-established pattern of global power dynamics between the Global North and South in which the latter concentrates the unwanted migrants of the former. It also creates an assumption that externalisation is a border control technology exclusively applied by Global North countries. Needless to say, such assumption is inaccurate. As externalisation makes it more dangerous and costly to migrate to Global North countries, new patterns of mobility emerge, and unforeseen destinations in the Global South arise as alternative routes for those migrants who do not wish to take such high risks. This, in turn, also triggers some of these unexpected destination countries to engage in similar externalisation technologies themselves, even if not as overtly as Global North states. This has been precisely the case for countries in South America, most notably Argentina and Brazil.In the case of Argentina, a growing number of Senegalese immigrants arriving over the course of the 2000s was noteworthy. This was partly due to European externalisation practices and their consequent more dangerous migration pathways, as well as a general understanding of Latin America as a more open region towards migrants with, at that time, a growing economic landscape. Senegalese immigrants would get Brazilian visas in Dakar, arrive regularly and then cross the Brazil-Argentine border irregularly. Once in Argentina, they would apply for asylum and be able to have access to a limited set of rights whilst waiting for the results of their asylum claim. With the significant increase in asylum applications by Senegalese individuals, the Argentine government pressured Brazilian authorities to halt visa authorisations to Senegalese citizens in an attempt to prevent further arrivals (Vammen, 2019).Visa policies and border diplomacy are not the most visible externalisation tactic, but they have long been applied and are well known in the case of Global North countries. Externalisation through restrictive visa policies among Global South countries, however, does not receive similar attention. Latin America, specifically, is mostly internationally praised and known for its progressive views, laws, and policies regarding migration and asylum. A similar look at how this progressive formal stance is parallel to more restrictive, securitarian and concealed mechanisms and practices of migration control is thus necessary to fully uncover the lived experiences of forcibly displaced migrants in the region. Similar to Argentina, Brazil also deployed diplomatic pressure on a neighbouring country, Ecuador, to change its visa policies in order to prevent the arrival of Haitian migrants.Since 2010, when Haiti was heavily affected by an earthquake, thousands of Haitians crossed the Brazil-Peruvian border. As of 2015, almost 45,000 Haitians had pending asylum applications in the Brazilian National Committee for Refugees (CONARE). Although Haitians currently have access to a specific humanitarian visa, this was not the case when they first started arriving in the country. Their displacement involved a complex trajectory, starting in Haiti or the Dominican Republic, through Ecuador, which then had an ‘open visa’ policy, followed by crossing Peru until reaching the border with the Brazilian state of Acre. Upon entering, Haitians applied for asylum, as there was no other permit available that fit their circumstances.Even after CONARE ruled that Haitians were not refugees, it did not prevent them from continuing to apply for asylum. In 2011, considering their constant asylum applications, the president of the CONARE disclosed, in an official meeting, that there were 3 alternatives for managing their migration, which were widely discussed by migrationfirst one would be a collective deportation to Haiti, which, despite its lengthy official discussion, was formally abandoned due to reported humanitarian responsibility and overall international illegality of collective deportations;The second, their recognition as refugees. Despite the acknowledged volatile and violent circumstances in Haiti, he disagreed with the recognition of Haitians, both in terms of the 1951 Convention and in terms of the more ample refugee concept prescribed in the Cartagena Declaration of 1984. He feared recognising Haitians as refugees prima facie through the Cartagena Declaration’s concept could mean an incentive to their displacement to Brazil; andThird, forwarding all collectively refused asylum claims to the country’s Immigration Council (CNIg), as it had been done since then. This is a very bureaucratic and complex measure which would legally allow the Brazilian government to award Haitians with an exceptional type of permit.Although some deportations were conducted, and with a very low number of Haitians recognised as refugees, the last option was the most applied throughout the years with regards to Haitians land border crossers. This was not done peacefully and smoothly, though. CNIg members frequently discussed a way to stop land crossings and concentrate visa applications in consular posts abroad. As such, CNIg issued a decision in 2012 which created a so-called ‘humanitarian visa’ for Haitians, limited to 1,200 a year, which would allow them to apply for a visa in Porto Príncipe. Although such measure was highly praised internationally, debates over this visa uncover the undesirability of Haitian newcomers and the desire of Brazilian authorities to keep their numbers to a minimum. One CNIg member even mentioned the numerical restriction for the humanitarian visa would be necessary so that Haitians would not become a diaspora in Brazil as well as to protect the labour market for Brazilians. In the end of 2012, having seen that the numerical visa cap did not prevent land border crossing, CNIg subsequently changed the initial wording of the visa and removed such limitation. At the same time, the then director of Immigration at the Ministry of Foreign Relations mentioned how Ecuador, the only country in South America with a visa waiver for Haitians, was key for reducing land migration, adding that although attempts to pressure Ecuadorian authorities had been unsuccessful, they would keep putting pressure on that country (debates registered in official CNIg meetings of January and December 2012).Indeed, no matter the many attempts to switch the migration pattern from irregular land border crossing to formal migration patterns, Haitians kept arriving at the Brazil-Peruvian border at the thousands until 2015, when Ecuador changed its visa policies towards Haiti, as Brazil had initially envisaged. While the official justification to increase border control in Ecuador through a restrictive visa policy was to prevent the action of smugglers, this was hardly based on any evidence. Research on migrant smuggling normally demonstrates quite the opposite, showing the more restrictive border controls are, the more dangerous journeys become, as well as more reliant on the work of smugglers so as to defy mobility controls (Sanchez, 2018). This was in fact demonstrated in the very own migration corridor undertaken by Haitians, after Peru lifted the visa exemption to Haitians in 2012, as a result of diplomatic pressures from Brazil (as seen here).Haitians either had to apply for a Brazilian visa in Quito or resort to a migrant smuggler to cross the Peruvian border irregularly. Many chose to do the latter, especially considering the long waiting periods for the visa (as seen on Melanie Montinard’s PhD dissertation, accessible here).Haitian migration to Brazil thus provides us with a contradictory migration policy landscape, in which, on the one hand, newly developed visa policies towards Haitians allowed formal pathways to migration and, on the other, Brazil continuously engaged in the externalisation of its border control, in order to stop spontaneous land arrivals from Haitians, through diplomatic attempts to influence a more restrictive visa policy in Ecuador. Despite the humanitarian nature of Brazil’s overall policy regarding Haitians, some of the official debates and practices demonstrate the undesirability of these migrants. Preventing spontaneous land crossings was thus one of the ways to increase control over numbers of spontaneous arrivals of Haitians, and albeit justifications were mostly based on the need to curb migrant smuggling, diplomatic pressures on Peru and Ecuador to lift their visa waivers to Haitians proved to do quite the opposite.After almost a decade of the existence of humanitarian visas for Haitians, and despite the significant decrease in their land arrivals as of 2015, there is still a significant number of Haitians who still cross Brazilian land borders and apply for asylum. In 2018, over 7,000 Haitians applied for asylum in Brazil after crossing a land border. This even made the then coordinator of CONARE state, in 2020, that Haitians still negatively pressure the asylum system in the country, despite the forced nature of their mobility. Even though official refugee decisions concerning Haitians have never changed, many scholars and activists still dispute their status (Hamlin, 2021). Considering waiting periods for the visa, financial constraints many migrants face, and lack of information, many Haitians still engage in a very restrictive and dangerous journey, and it is likely these migrants face even greater vulnerability until they are able to reach Brazil and other South Americanof border control in South America therefore still affects Haitians trying to cross Ecuador and Peru. It also demonstrates how such practices, most commonly reported in the Global North, are also present in migration management strategies in South-South migration corridors, as demonstrated. Argentina and Brazil are both widely considered more open to migrants than Global North countries, with a normative system that seems to offer less barriers to regular status. Although this is indeed true, it is important to look at institutional practices, official debates and how visa policies are applied on a day-to-day basis so as to uncover the unsaid political will in South America. As Lesser (2013:147) mentions, referring to the historic Brazilian governmental migratory practice, ‘Brazilian immigration policy was never straightforward. Sometimes secret policies were more important than official ones’. Concealed practices in migration governance are still paramount to uncover political will and lived experiences of migrants and refugee in the many stages of displacement, i.e. pre-departure, during transit, upon settlement and return. Externalisation through the use of visa policies thus appears as a less overt measure to repel and deter those migrants and refugees who, despite the official established normative infrastructure, are undesirables.In Brazil, specifically, research concerning visa policies is key to uncover other externalisation strategies. Difficulties accessing official data on visas and diplomatic communication, however, can be a considerable barrier, although some developments in qualitative research. They indicate further attempts to externalise border control in South-South migration corridors. One of such cases are depicted in the increasing discretionary practices involving visa denials concerning family reunification permits for refugees, especially those of African origin (Martuscelli, 2020), particularly victims of unreasonable and life-threatening waiting periods. Shedding light over such otherwise concealed practices will hopefully provoke regional activists, researchers, and migrant organisations to engage in strategies to uncover the consequences of externalisation practices both in South America and other Global South geographies. It is therefore key to engage in a more ample debate over how visa policies and other practices in the Global South contribute in shifting these countries’ borders, as well as in creating different spaces of (im)mobility, and increasing the vulnerability of migrants and refugees in these regions."

Museums have committed to better value and integrate the perspectives of Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) and to recurate exhibits to better acknowledge the racist violence of the past. Some applaud these practices, casting them also as integral to the project of decolonizing museums.However, can museums be decolonized? Like many statues and monuments, they are creations of the colonial era, which may well make this objective unattainable. Yet, some activists claim it is worth pursuing. Others, such as Eve Tuck and K Wayne Yang, object to using the term decolonization with reference to the reform of colonial institutions, and reserve it to designate the repatriation of stolen land and life to indigenous population. These debates have not yet considered the case of war memorials and museums, which we explore here through the case of two memorials to the experiences of Japanese Americans during World War II.We first consider the Poston Memorial Monument, which is located on the Colorado River Indian Reservation. The Reservation, which stretches along the Colorado River along the border between eastern California and Arizona, was established in 1865 following a negotiation between the Mohaves, who had ancestrally occupied the land, the Chemehuevi, who had moved to the area in the 1800s, and Colonel Charles Poston, the Superintendent of Arizona’s Indian Agency. The gold rush, which brought white settlers to spread from the East towards California, threatened indigenous peoples and ways of life. The settler’s mining ambitions stripped the Mohaves and Chemehuevis of large parts of their land. In the early 1900s, the US government implemented policies designed to erase indigenous culture, such as the forceful displacement of children into boarding schools and the prohibition of traditional ceremonies.The Colorado River Indian Tribes suffered another dispossession between May 1942 and November 1945 when the government requisitioned the land to incarcerate 17,800 people of Japanese ancestry in camps named after Charles Poston. A few months earlier, US President Franklin Roosevelt had mandated the forced relocation of Japanese Americans into incarceration camps, of which Poston would be the largest. Of the 120,000 Japanese Americans who were forcibly displaced, a third were stationed on Indian Reservations. In addition to Poston, camps were built on Native land at Gila River, Arizona, and Heart Mountain, Wyoming.After the war, Japanese American activists and camp survivors transformed the former incarceration camps into educational and commemorative spaces. The Poston Memorial Monument was built in 1992, thanks to the collaboration of the Colorado River Indian Tribe (CRIT). The CRIT Council set aside forty acres of reservation land to restore the Poston site and affirm its historical significance. The Council also granted use of one acre of land for a monument, designed to represent a Japanese stone lantern, and kiosk, and currently working on a museum project. The Poston Memorial serves as a symbol for the unity of spirit, collaboration and open conversation between the descendents of Japanese American survivors and Indigenous communities, bonded through their shared experience of confinement andcase of the Poston Memorial highlights how the violence of institutionalized racism and settler colonialism intersect. It records how Japanese Americans’ designation as ‘enemy aliens’ led to their incarceration. Individuals of German and Italian descent did not suffer the same fate, evidencing this policy as founded on racialization. Such racialization, as Tuck and Yang note, is a tool deployed by colonial elites to establish control over the territory it has settled and secure the settler elite’s own growth.However, racialized groups experience the violence of internal colonialism in different ways and to varying degrees. After World War II ended, the Japanese American incarcerees were released and left the camp. In contrast, many indigenous people of the Colorado River Indian Tribe stayed on the reservation. For them, leaving would mean losing their home and community support due to the continual erasure of their cultural heritage outside of the reservation.These differences complicate solidarity amongst minoritized groups against settler colonialism. It’s uncomfortable to admit, but both white and non-white settlers directly and indirectly benefit from the erasure and assimilation of Indigenous peoples, by occupying stolen Indigenous land and living off forcibly taken resources like water and minerals. There is a risk for Japanese Americans of using the incarceration experience to deny or deflect their own complicity in settler colonialism. Japanese Americans and other non-white settler communities therefore have a shared responsibility to reflect on their implication in colonial processes.The Poston Memorial Monument should help us see the difference between diversity/inclusion and decolonization at sites of memory. The Japanese American community curated the preserved camps and the memorial in conversation with Native American communities. Non-white perspectives were therefore central to the site’s curation. However, decolonization is more than the representation of BIPOC in curatorial teams and the valorization of their perspectives. Following Tuck and Yang’s more demanding definition, decolonization should produce material changes for indigenous people, such as the repatriation of stolen land and resources.Can museums and memorials enable such material changes? They may not immediately contribute to material redistribution. However, by educating about past and continuing violence, they can invite visitors to see the decolonization of land and resources as a possible and desirable outcome. Like other sites of memory, The Poston Memorial promotes decolonial thinking by acknowledging indigenous sovereignty, and humanizing native communities by telling their stories. Museums and memorials may also normalize the repatriation of stolen land and artefacts when they agree to restore them to indigenous communities.We now turn to a second memorial, the National Japanese American Memorial to Patriotism During World War II in Washington, D.C.. The memorial is located not too far from the US Capitol, a land once populated by the people of Natcotchtank. This memorial pays tribute to Japanese American incarcerees, as well as to Japanese Americans who gave their lives for the US military during World War II. The simple design includes seven quotes engraved in stone walls. The first six quotes are from the Japanese American elected officials Daniel Inouye, Robert Matsui, and Norman Mineta; the US presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Ronald Reagan.The seventh quote is by the wartime Japanese American Citizens League leader Mike Masaoka, and drawn from Masaoka’s controversial Japanese American Creed. The latter promoted an assimilationist strategy during the anti-Japanese hysteria of the 1940s. This strategy included loyalty campaigns promoting the acceptance of the evacuation order as a bid to gain safeguards from the government. Problematically, quoting the Creed in the monument suggests that patriotism is the same as cooperating with the government, including when it enacts racist policies. For similar reasons, many Japanese American camp survivors are opposed to being honored alongside fallen veterans, and question whether the two experiences should be commemorated in the samediscomfort is understandable. By celebrating assimilation and military service as a response to racial injustice, the memorial weaponizes patriotism as a mode of control. Patriotism, in this case, serves to deflect attention away from a settler colonial and racist policy, by celebrating loyalty to a state that operates through colonial modes, rather than question it. This is not to invalidate the choice and valor of Japanese American soldiers whose names are inscribed on the walls of the monument. However, centering their service and emphasizing it as the most valued response to displacement, dispossession and incarcerable is questionable. It distracts from the injustice perpetrated against Japanese Americans and indigenous communities, and from efforts to challenge this injustice.We conclude with thoughts on the intersection of feminist and decolonial thinking. All quotes engraved on the walls of the DC monument are of men. In contrast, Japanese American women’s voices are silenced. This situation is not unique to the DC memorial. Missing from most public narratives of the internment of Japanese Americans are stories of violence against women. Women ‘experienced incarceration not just as a violation of their civil rights but of their physical safety and bodily autonomy, their freedom of movement constricted not just by barbed wire and high desert but by the constant threat of sexual violence.’ The cramped conditions in incarceration camps created an environment favourable to abuse, and sexual assault is rumoured to have taken place at Poston. Women were harassed, followed, and threatened when moving through public spaces like the latrines and the showers. Many incidents went unreported due to the little trust Japanese American women had in US authorities as a source of protection.Even if they integrate decolonial thinking, which the Poston Memorial does, memorials do not present a full picture if they focus on men’s experiences of racism and colonialism. Silencing women’s stories allows non-white men to control the narrative of past injustice and hide the ‘stories that bear witness to the ways victims of institutional harm can become perpetrators of individual violence’. Conversely, memorial designs that silence the experience of women perpetuate ‘the silence and sacrifice demanded of women of color from both within and without their own communities’. As they grapple with the challenges of decolonization, diversity, and inclusion, memorials ought to adopt an intersectional perspective, through which experiences of racism and colonial violence can be recognized as mediated by gender.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/30/climate-change-human-mobility-and-feminist-political-economy/,"Climate Change, Human Mobility and Feminist Political Economy",Betty Barkha,Sep 30 2021,"As thousands fled from their homes across Afghanistan, the world watched in horror and despair, again! People have been forced from their homes, cities and countries because of violent conflict, extremist groups and increasing insecurities. Yet, another crisis looms close and global leaders continue to ignore its severity. The climate crisis, through both sudden and slow-onset environmental impacts like cyclones, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, droughts, floods and wildfires has caused over 30.7 million new displacements in 2020. Climate change-induced human mobilities, such as migration, forced displacement or planned retreat/ relocation, are almost always projected as an issue of the future, but the climate crisis is no longer a futuristic threat. As in most crises, the impacts and experiences vary by individual characteristics and intersecting circumstances such as age, ethnicity, socio-economic class, geographical location, disability and gender. However, if global leaders and the international community act proactively and with urgency, there is opportunity to not only prevent another humanitarian crisis but use it as an opportunity to transform social and gender injustices.Changes in the climate and environmental degradation are pushing people to consider mobility as a form of adaptation, inherently posing risks to all dimensions of human security: personal, environmental, economic, health, food, community and political security. Despite evolving research, there is a gap in directly connecting human mobility to impacts of climate change and natural disasters. Evidence shows that areas of the world are becoming less habitable due to sudden and slow-onset climate related hazards, however directly attributing human mobility to impacts of climate change remain difficult. While people move for numerous reasons, even in the face of a climate crisis there are underlying socioeconomic, cultural, political and environmental processes that either enable or hinder people’s ability to cope where they are or result in them moving (See: Gemenne et al., 2014; Warner, 2018; Bower and Weerasinghe, 2021). However, the degree to which people are affected by climate change and their decisions on climate induced mobility are heavily linked to gender, age, socio-economic status, power over and access to resources.Across all cases of climate change-induced movements of people, whether forced or voluntary, there are significant challenges posed to human security, self-determination, identity, culture, loss of home and adaptation to the ways of host communities. Currently, there is opportunity to holistically address existing insecurities, protect homes, communities and livelihoods while also using it as a prospect to transform existing social and gender inequalities. At a global level, initial mention of climate change-induced human mobility was at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties in 2010 through the Cancun Adaptation Framework and has since been recognised in the Paris Agreement, Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and more broadly within the Women, Peace and Security agenda and Sustainable Development Goals. This means that any action in response to climate change induced human mobility is already a part of pre-agreed outcomes that requires localisation. Many developing countries, who are on the frontlines of the climate crises have actively started planning for relocations if the need arises. For example, countries like Jamaica and Zambia have launchedResettlement Strategies and plans targeted at disaster risk management and climate adaptation efforts. Countries like Myanmar and Vietnam have also been progressively undertaking planned relocation in the Delta region for flood affected populations. The situation worsens for Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) because of its geographical remoteness, vulnerability to climate impacts and the land size of the islands. All Pacific SIDs are considering human mobility options within and across borders, such as migration pathways and planned relocation.Studies on climate-induced planned relocation, forced displacement and climate migration continue to demonstrate how disruptive they can be to various aspects of human security and the social fabric of communities (Pill 2020; Piggott-McKellar, McNamara, and Nunn 2019). The costs of climate change adaptation and induced mobilities are much higher than just economic and financial losses. Pacific SIDS communities’ challenges and complexities include, but are not limited to, changes in the ecosystems such as increasing salinity, sea-level rise, coral bleaching, freshwater contamination, increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters. The World Bank estimates that adaptation initiatives will cost Pacific SIDS significantly, for example coastal protection efforts alone might cost the Marshall Islands USD $58 million (13 percent of GDP) and Fiji USD $329 million (3 percent of GDP) per year (World Bank 2017). These projections were based on the best-case scenario and did not account for other adaption efforts or disaster recovery and response initiatives. The non-economic losses of climate change induced mobility have been identified in literature as impacting physical and psychological wellbeing, sense of belonging, cultural heritage, disruptions to social cohesion, family structures and changed labour conditions.Undertakings like planned relocations require dedicated finances, experts and extensive consultations with the affected community. Past experiences of planned relocation show an increase in landlessness, unemployment, socio-economic inequalities, food scarcity, conflict and an overall deterioration in well-being (McLeman and Gemenne 2018; Adger et al. 2014; McAdam 2010). Currently, most planned relocation efforts are largely state-led protection interventions undertaken to safeguard people from impacts of climate change and natural disasters, ideally thorough transparent participatory consultations with thedecisions on planned relocation (when, where, why and how) involve the exercise of power by the various stakeholders involved, for this thesis it is primarily the state and the community. Power in this context refers to the ability of individuals and institutions to influence decisions that are critical to the process of relocations, for example, control and allocation of resources or access to training and outreach initiatives (Bertana 2020; Tanyag and True 2019). Studies from Fiji’s relocation of the Vunidogoloa village show that despite improved infrastructure and living conditions, the women felt burdened in the social reproductive roles. Research also shows how local and traditional structures continued to limit women’s input from decision making spaces. ‘You are not told that you cannot attend, but if you are not specifically asked to attend then you do not go’ (Bertana 2020, 12). My current research further examines how gender disparities are (and can be) addressed based on the premise of safeguarding human security and how it impacts the wider political economy.Feminist Political Economy of Climate Change-Induced Human Mobility in FijiWithin Politics and International Relations scholarship, the study of political economy is targeted at understanding who benefits, who holds power and who makes the decisions. In the case of climate change-induced human mobility, particularly for populations most impacted such as those in Pacific SIDs communities, this involves examining the role of the state, international partners and context of the affected community. For example, Fiji’s state-led efforts and responses to planned relocation need to consider social, cultural and traditional aspects that are strongly linked to individual and communal identity for the iTaukei community (indigenous Fijians). For non-indigenous Fijians, such as Indo-Fijians the complexities are linked to their sense of belonging to the land they call home. In taking a feminist approach, this includes recognising gender inequality and high rates of sexual and gender-based violence for Pacific women, girls and gender non-binary individuals who remain vulnerable in face of climate change. For example, post tropical cyclone Winston in Fiji, in addition to a bill of USD $900 million in losses and damages, there were significant impacts on women led households which led to economic, health and personal security concerns. This included loss of income for households dependent on primary industries like farming and fisheries and a notable increase in sexual and gender-based violence post-disasters.Additionally, the burden of care for family members also fell on the women and girls, mostly because of social norms that dictate gendered behaviour. Women are primary care providers in Fiji, disruptions such as forced displacements, planned relocations and ad-hoc community consultations have a significant impact on mothers as they face increased pressure to meet domestic responsibilities, especially in terms of food security and accessing necessary childcare. Social reproduction and care are a crucial element of gendered norms and practices that are accepted. The time spent on paid work and unpaid work in households and communities is a crucial element in understanding value, through an expanded lens of money, labour and time.Across intersections of multi-cultural and multi-ethnic communities in Fiji, the impact of climate change-induced displacement and planned relocation has major psycho-social impacts. State-led responses, such as Planned Relocation and Displacement Guidelines need to holistically account for the complex relationships between the land and people. There is also potential for efforts directed at planned relocation and displacement to transform social practices, for instance, in reducing gender inequality. Aligning global and regional climate policy instruments with national level action plans that centre human security and gender justice are crucial pathway forward. Pacific SIDS like Fiji require financial, technical, and capacity support to address loss and damage, enhance implementation of adaptation plans, integrate focus areas of the Paris Agreement Gender Action Plan (GAP) and the Warsaw Mechanism. We can respond to the plea of Pacific Islanders fighting to save their homes, but we can also use it as an opportunity to change so muchThere is much that remains unexamined, but we have sufficient evidence that clarifies the gendered impacts of climate change. The responses to climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts need to be targeted at not only addressing climate change impacts but also reducing gender and social inequalities. Science alone is insufficient, planning and implementation efforts need to prioritise a human security centred, human rights-based approach that recognises the intersectional gendered impacts of climate-induced human mobility. Climate change is a global security threat and must be addressed as such through dedicated resources and intersectional analysis which recognises situated knowledge of those most affected. Global leaders have seen first-hand the devastation of people being displaced within the last decade, there is currently time to proactively accelerate action to avoid another crisis. Immediate global action on climate change needs be based on basis of collaboration, solidarity and co-responsibility of a crisis that will be devastating for us all."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/28/theatres-of-difference-the-film-hair-otherness-alterity-subjectivity-and-lessons-for-identity-politics/,"Theatres of Difference: The Film ‘Hair’, Otherness, Alterity, Subjectivity and Lessons for Identity Politics",Patricia Sohn,Sep 28 2021,"What do Martin Buber, Emmanuel Levinas, Edward Said, Timothy Mitchell, and the 1979 American musical film, “Hair,” share in common?They all provide us with lessons – in the case of the scholars, a few conditioned by circumstances in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) – that may be useful in considering the issues of identity politics that confront us today in the public sphere with movements such as Black Lives Matter taking center stage in our political discourses, if not in our developing thoughts and ideas.Martin Buber’s I-Thou; Levinas’ ethical concern for self-preservation in the relational moment; observations from Edward Said and MENA; and the sort of profound and brave self-critiques of one’s own cultural centers and their cultural, political, and historical relationship(s) with Others such as seen in the work of Timothy Mitchell, are prescient to issues of identity in domestic politics and culture, at the theoretical level, in the U.S. today.Drawing upon the film adaptation of the musical, “Hair,” I suggest an approach to it as a cultural text[1] – that is, film as an ethnographic material-cultural source[2] – read through the insights of these Jewish, Middle Eastern, European, and American thinkers in order to highlight some issues of identity politics, and to relate them to the contemporary hour.I suggest that Buber, Levinas, Said, Mitchell, and others may offer a way out of ephemeral and fleeting experiences of solidarity across usually hardened divisions to more sustained engagement with appropriate boundaries regarding appreciating the other as Thou/Subject with subjectivity and self-contained, legitimate, and important difference to be respected for its autonomy (as culture and as heritage), and protecting ourselves as I/Subjects with subjectivity as well – even in the relational moment.I-Thou, I-it, alterity, subjectivity, and evolving from the post-colonial momentIn the early 20th century, Martin Buber tells us that, in encountering the other, we have a choice.We may encounter the other as an “It” with all of the trappings of not-quite-inanimate object, including limited consciousness attributed to the other,[3] limited feeling or sympathy for the other, and seeing the self and others as something akin to a semi-conscious machine.[4]The I in the I-It relationship can think in terms of duality (or, perhaps an “absence of duality”) but not in terms of unity for Buber.[5]Or, we can encounter the other as a “Thou” with all that we, today, tend to associate with subject: humanness, consciousness, sympathy, and what we might now call immanence[6] or the recognition of what Buber calls the world-spirit in both I and Thou.[7]Buber uses the word subject slightly differently, differentiating subject and subjectivity, where subjectivity reflects full personhoodas noted in the following.If we choose the I-It relationship, we become subjects conscious of the self in Buber’s terms (e.g., individuals aware of the self as subject and aware of the exterior, where subject means “experiencing and using”),[8] but lacking our own full subjectivity in our unwillingness to recognize the full subjectivity of the other.If we choose the latter, the I-Thou relationship, we become more than subjects and gain full subjectivity ourselves (e.g., we become full persons).That is, it is in the relational moment, in recognizing the full subjectivity of the other as a Thou, that we gain full subjectivity ourselves as persons.Buber explains:Individuality makes its appearance by being differentiated from other individualities.A person makes his appearance by entering into relation with other persons.The one is the spiritual form of natural detachment, the other is the spiritual form of natural solidarity and connexion.[9] [sic]In choosing to remain with the I-It relationship rather than the I-Thou, we live as something close to a semi-conscious machine, unaware of the potential subjectivity of both self and other.Indeed, the I holding on to the I-It relationship treats himself or herself as an It as well.For Buber, Napoleon (and to some extent the modern individual) vaguely represents this archetype.[10]Buber suggests that in the world of humanity no one is pure individual (I-It, subject with no subjectivity), and no one is pure person (I-Thou with full subjectivity).Indeed, “True history is decided in the field between these two poles.”[11]The I of the individual wends contradiction and conflict; the I of the person brings meaningful interaction and appropriate dignity to the world–spirit in each/all of us.[12]I would go even further to suggest that, at least theoretically, by implication, many of the worlds of war and social conflict are fought in the battle between Buber’s two poles:individuals holding on to the I-It relationship; and full persons engaged in I-Thou relationship among subjectivities and resulting in solidarity and connection.It is by now an old adage that it is difficult to dehumanize an Other who you have since humanized in your approach to him, her, or them.All the more, it would be difficult to dehumanize and strip the subjectivity from those with whom one has built relationships of solidarity and connection through a mutual recognition of the subjectivity of, and world-spirit in, each, as inherent in the I-Thou relationship.To do so, one would have to devolve to the I-It relationship, and, thus, strip the self of its subjectivity as well – for however long the dehumanizing lasts.For Buber, the I-It is an inherent refusal to recognize the world-spirit in the other.That is, it is not only a developmental stage; it is a failing at the level of spirit.For Emmanuel Levinas, the other is both proximal and what he calls a radical Alterity.[13]That is, the other lives in proximity to I, the Subject, requiring attention and thought, and, yet, it is always radically apart and different from the I-Subject.So, he uses the language slightly differently than does Buber; and he engages Buber directly in suggesting that the moment of encounter between I, as Subject, and the other, as radical Alterity, holds within it an ethical problem: encountering the other as Subject brings with it peril.[14]For Levinas, the effort to be is a sort of first principle in philosophical terms.[15]And humans are “nostalgic” for the other in as much as we are transcendental Is.Levinas begins with the love relationship, which is sometimes implied in Buber as well.That is, for both, the male-female relationship sometimes stands in for, or is a prime example of, the relationship between I-Subject and other asthe arrival of the human there is already the vigilance for the other. The transcendental I in its nakedness comes from the awakening by and for the other.[16]Thus, the move to relation with the other as subjectivity (in Buber’s terms, as a Thou) implies a de-centering of self that takes one away from the first principle, the effort to be, for Levinas (which includes self-preservation).And, approaching the other as an I/Subject, as Buber demands of us, assumes that the other will behave ethically and return the favor, treating I, myself, in a similarly humane way that accounts for and respects my (humanity and) subjectivity.Levinas warns that this assumption cannot be made, a priori.It is a false assumption.Therefore, extending the self (I/Subject) to the other (radical Alterity) holds inherent dangers until the other’s willingness to reciprocity is observed.[17]Moreover, Levinas argues that the I-Thou relationship in Buber assumes that we are all equals, another assumption with which Levinas argues we cannot begin.Levinas suggests that the relationship with the other implies responsibility, (almost commercial) exchange (of good behavior), and obligation; add to that a third party, then these issues become still more complicated and begin to include questions of justice – who is more prior as other?[18]In the cases of both scholars, there is reason to believe that not only gender, as mentioned above, but also the Arab-Israeli conflict was a backdrop to at least some of the thinking of each on otherness.[19]The problematique raised by Levinas taken under advisement, we turn to Edward Said, perhaps most famous outside the academic world for his political policy stances on Palestinian identity and freedoms.[20]He brought into stark relief some of the dangers of persisting in treating the other as a radical alterity within scholarship and in popular imagination (e.g., representations).He provides a rich historiography of research on the Middle East (e.g., then called the Orient, broadly) as conducted by European scholars over the course of a few centuries.He highlights, among other issues, problems with vantage derived from the lack of experience in the field (e.g., in locale) necessary to gain direct material and cultural knowledge, as well as that regarding, precisely, the subjectivity of the other; and ways in which lack of appropriate peer review process can lead to significant misconstructions of a whole region in accounts from the scholarly to arts, music, and theatre.[21]Those misconstructions, Said avers, were reproduced in representations that drew, at times, upon their antecedents to support one misconstrual after the other.And, he argues, more controversially, that some historical Europeans created a shadow self in the Orient through (mis-)representation to foster a grand European identity via representations of a denuded, conquered, and exotic Orient (e.g., MENA).[22]Scholars such as Timothy Mitchell take this work still further, in self-critique (e.g., critique of one’s own cultural center), to analyze 19th century representation, exhibition, spectacle, and the Western “gaze” upon the Middle East.[23]For example, some European visitors to MENA responded with horror when they found the real place not exhibiting the characteristics they had seen at World Fairs and the like in Europe.[24]And, indeed, some (including parts of the colonial apparatus) sought to re-order the region to fit their prior representations.[25]Such specific examples of cross-cultural mis-comprehension are one of the controversial – and also most powerfully important – components of such post-colonial theories in aiding us to avoid similar cross-cultural blunders today, either at home or abroad.Such debacles should not mean that we give up in our endeavor to understand the other.To the contrary, if we begin with Buber’s elevated aspiration to approach the transcendental though the I-Thou engagement with the other; and we add to that, perhaps, a correction for self-preservation as found in Levinas; we find that the other is always in proximity to the I-Subject.That is, we live in a multicultural society and a multicultural world.There is no avoiding the other.The only question is how to engage one another in a productive – or possibly even a sincerely warm and engaging – manner.The discussion of “Hair,” below, outlines some of the lines of otherness, between and among communities, within the American context at least historically.note, the Middle East, like most regions, has its own others, divides, and debates across sub-communities, including those between religious and secular; rich and poor; traditional and modern; settled and nomadic (even today, although less so than before the mid-19th century); gender; religion; and a variety of political preferences.The religious-secular divide, in my view, is one of the most important and drives many other political and social debates in the region, where secularism was experienced for much of the 20th century in MENA as secular authoritarianism rather than as an open conference table for a free marketplace of ideas.[26]The traditional/modern divide corresponds, at the least, with tensions between those engaged in traditional, nomadic, agricultural-, or small-market based enterprises by contrast with those who do their work in modern professions with internet connections, behind glass, and in high-rises in contemporary cities.The distinction between the Berbers of the Atlas Mountains and the tech haven of Dubai well marks the range of differences in this spectrum.[27]Such differences do rise to conflicts, some of which the average reader knows well (for example, Sayyid Qutb’s critique of modern, secular Egypt under Nasser, as well as of Western Christianity, communism, and capitalism);[28] while others are more obscured to us, either because they are expressed at the micro-level, or because they come to the fore through circuitous routes and are worked out on tangential or even arbitrary issues.The film, “Hair,” as material-cultural-historical text: uplifting, appalling, unifying lessons & gaffesLines of difference as experienced in the West also range significantly on religious-secular issues; rich and poor; traditional and modern; gender; and – civil/military.With these lines of difference noted, some of our own sub-cultures emerge more clearly.Add to and within them issues of race and ethnicity; a propensity toward anti-monarchism as an operating (and, in my view, unfortunate) principle; and, together with traditional and modern comes the rural-urban divide.These categories reflect some of our more uncomfortable differences, which we have a tendency to keep opaque even to ourselves.What is at stake in them?Have we hidden the validity of such differences in a hegemony of an imagined center; or, perhaps more, a hegemony of urban cultures?“Hair” (dir. Milos Forman, 1979),[29] the film, highlights many of these in the tumultuous years of the late 1960s and early 1970s (the film is a reproduction of the 1968 stage production, which topically centered upon the 1960s).The film addresses a period worth remembering for its enthusiasm, exuberant and successful social mobilization, claims to righteousness, as well as for its seediness, ugliness, and depravity.The film is a material, ethnographic record of American society in this period; and, while it plays somewhat like a graphic novel in caricatures of each character, one after the other, it is nonetheless a disturbing but accurate portrayal of differences in American society in that time.Parts of it are violently obscene (such as a song advocating pedophilia).And, yet, it remains rated at PG, which is surprising to sensibilities of 2021.That rating may reflect the extent to which those extremely seedy parts of the musical film were widely accepted as part of popular culture at the time.Other parts are wonderful and would likely read as uplifting to many Americans.Throughout, pieces of a range of American sub-cultures are detailed, as is a radical divide between them.It helps to view the film with subtitles so that none of the dialogue or lyrics are missed.Indeed, the film can be read as a cultural text drawing from the methods of textual and cultural analysis.[30]Likewise, it is suggested here that, where archaeology approaches material culture in archaeological finds as text, film can also be approached as a cultural text representing certain aspects of our (especially micro-level) political culture(s), pervading ideas, and/or debates.[31]The traditional/modern and rural/urban divides are represented as one man (John Savage’s elegantly delivered character, Claude) comes from the mid-West to the Big Apple – New York City – to find himself drawn into a small community of free-loving Hippies engaged in all manner of drugs, crime, and lascivious activities.If the reader has not viewed the film in some time, my characterization may sound too conservative; I have to recommend viewing it again, as it may, indeed, be shocking to current sensibilities given our now deep concerns regarding issues of sexual harassment, real criminal activity, drugs, our lack of patience for public nuisance behaviors, and the like.Likewise, a divide between rich and poor is displayed, handily, along with what can only be described as a significant class divide.Again, the viewer today may see these reenactments of social and political acting-out with less of a rosy gloss than did fans in decades past.Treat Williams’ resplendent rendition of his character, Berger, is horrifying and constitutes a symbolic and material (as film) reminder of what some people went through in the period.That is, his character is a reminder of the extremes of that era.Berger is, at once, predator and villain – overtly – and also a victim at somethe film displays, visually and musically, anger, angst, worry, rectitude, and civil strife on the streets.All of it is related to race, ethnicity, demands for changing gender roles and identities, haves and have-nots, and class struggles that are tied to battles amongst the standing cultural hegemonies of the moment.Mid-West Claude most likely should have married the pregnant girl who offers to do so rather than waiting for the glossy-eyed debutante who only has eyes for Berger.The song, “An Old Fashioned Melody,” dramatizes these issues.[32]Instead, Claude follows Berger down the proverbial rabbit hole without which there would be no movie musical.Berger remarks of Claude, “It’s his first day in America.He just got off the boat,” as though the mid-West were so far away from Hippie-Central-NYC that it might as well be “Manchester, England, England!”[33]As an historical marker, the film’s cast includes many African Americans, as well as many other peoples of color.Songs such as, “Colored Spade,”[34] give expression to African American material and cultural frustrations, as well as much mainstream Euro-American disregard of the same issues at the time.The song begins as a list of epithets and job titles commonly used against African Americans, and limiting their professional achievement, including, “Cottin pickin’…junk man, shoeshine boy, elevator operator, table cleaner at Horn & Hardart….”[35]The song succeeds in re-appropriating these terms as empowerment for those in the scene, and, hopefully, for African American society more broadly.The epithets are hard, callous, and easily remembered.[36]That is, the critiques seen in the Black Lives Matter movement today are echoes of experiences expressed publicly already forty years ago (and, of course, earlier than that).In the denouement of the song, Dorsey Wright’s radiant and courageous character, Lafayette/Hud, presents himself as, “Resident of Harlem, and President of the United States of Love!”[37]And, he asserts, “If you ask this man to dinner, you’re going to have to feed him!”[38]That is, he will not be assumed to be a servant.The song proceeds to make a list of culinary items, including hominy grits, collard greens, and black-eyed peas;[39] basic access to sufficient healthy foods is highlighted as a continuing issue for African Americans at the time.The song is a musical enactment expressing African American umbrage and reasons for it.Moreover, it is presented in some ways in the scene as verbal expression of complaint taking the place of rumble; expression appears to make potential and posturing violent conflict unnecessary.“Ain’t Got No”[40] raises these issues of haves and have-nots with an introduction of, “I’m black, I’m black” (Hud); “I’m pink, I’m pink” (Don Dacus, Woof); “I’m Rinso white” (Berger); and Claude from the rural farming mid-West sings, “I’m invisible….”[41]It speaks of black-white issues as well as class issues, including the term, “white trash,” all in the same moment with a cast unified across these lines (unlike the wider society).The unity may be limited to an ephemeral moment of conjoined dance/ballet, however.That is, while some characters openly use drugs in the film, some members of the chorus sing that they do not even have enough money for the drugs that the Hippies value so highly for their trips (e.g., “Ain’t got no grass; can’t take no trip.Ain’t got no acid; can’t blow my mind”).[42]With a rousing call to faith (or plea to God), the song ends, “Ain’t got no faith.Ain’t got no God!”[43]On the contrary, “Black Boys”[44] is used in the film to poke fun at the military and at the draft – one of the major themes of the musical.The song’s subtext in the film, but primary content in terms of words and topic, relate to Black pride (rather than umbrage, as in the songs mentioned above).The song employs counter-stereotypes of both “black boys” and “white boys” in ways that seek, before their time, to address intersectionality[45] in some way; however, it is jarring due to its use of stereotyping language.Nonetheless, the song and scene also raise (and skirt a detailed discussion of the gender issues involved in) a subject treated as subtext in the film: homosexuality.The man with red painted toenails, and male nudity, are the first signals of this subtext in the staging, as is the male military panel singing in the song.[46]The content is highly sexualized and is surprising, again, for achieving a PG rating by contrast to our cultural sensibilities today.While the film takes on issues of race, color, sexual identity, and power politics, it often does so by staging songs in ways that make them appear to be about social critique of something else, such as the draft.It is a common strategy in the film that appears to allow it to unmask deeper social and cultural conflicts at the micro-level, which may otherwise have been too controversial.It is worth situating this 1979 film in socio-cultural context; it was released the same year as: The Amityville Horror; Rocky 2; Apocalypse Now; The Muppet Movie; Star Trek: The Motion Picture; The Jerk; Moonraker; and Alien.[47]The stage production may have addressed these issues more significantly.[48]Indeed, the Don Dacus character, “Woof,” is used as a foil for the question, which is left as a question rather than being answered.While no one accuses Berger of the same for his long hair, when Woof refuses to have his long golden locks shorn, a prison counselor asks if he likes men.It is made a key topic in his case.The brilliance, idealism, and shining hope of the musical’s opening song, “The Age of Aquarius,”[49] gives way immediately to the debased.The song, “Sodomy,”[50] which follows immediately, can be read as young people throwing out words that they have heard and sound interesting to them, and about which they do not know.Or, it can be read as making public the extent to which the sorts of terms bandied about by the young men in the song – such as, “pederasty” – were salient to the characters’ life experience, perhaps explaining controversy at the time of the stage production’s first appearance.[51]That is, the film offers an historical testament to the (veiled) cultural prevalence of sexual misuse of girls and women, and also of boys and young men in that era.It is Woof who, in the film, sings the deeply disturbing song; the word, “pederasty,” appears almost as an afterthought – which it clearly is not.In that sense, it can be read as artists and writers acting out and publicizing the broad parameters as well as micro-level dynamics in society around them.And, indeed, 1979 in some ways marked the end of the Hippies and the beginning of a more culturally conservative (one might say, more moderate) society with regard to thesedebutante young woman who is tired of restrictions, rules of politesse, locked windows, and tight laces raises important gender and class issues in the film.She is enamored of the grimy and wild Berger, while Claude – who would take her away from it all for a legitimate and stable life – stands by and tries to court her.The cultural conflict between Hippies and mid-West is highlighted in the relationship between Claude and Berger.It is the class conflict in which the Hippie movement is involved that is displayed in Berger’s vulgar (and charismatic) burlesque atop the 5th Avenue dining table of Beverly D’Angelo’s brilliantly played (and mindless)[53] debutante character, Sheila, in “I’ve Got Life.”[54]That theme pervades throughout the movie and is usually displayed in a Hippie vs. 5th Avenue encounter rather than one between Claude’s mid-West traditionalism and 5th Avenue modernist (for that contemporary moment) affluence.The latter is a theme that remains undeveloped.The post-colonial message is overt.[55]For example, at a demonstration in Central Park, a movement leader says: “The draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend land they stole from the red people.”[56]Of course, the reified and in some ways openly racist nature of some of these color-terms is not questioned by the speakers (e.g., “the yellow” people and “the red” people, in particular, do not necessarily self-identify in this way).The Hindu and Eastern Religions movement arrives, as historically accurate, in song periodically.The film culminates with the anti-Vietnam war message, which is obvious with several anti-war songs and with Claude coming to New York in the first instance to respond to his draft notice; he ultimately joins the military, marking another divide in our society – civil/military.On the other hand, Cheryl Barnes’ character, Lafayette/Hud’s fiancée, arrives to provide her own critique of the Hippie movement for its abiding concern for social justice and caring for “strangers” while ignoring the traditional responsibilities of home and family, which remain, nonetheless, still present.[57]The free-love message is both adulated (with “Good Morning Starshine,”[58] for example) and criticized in its seedy irresponsibility.The finale, “Let the Sunshine,” [59] is a haunting and powerful statement of the humanity of military personnel and what they sacrifice.At the same time, it entreats our society to consider paths other than sending our (young) men (and women) to fight.Concluding remarksThe film is an historical document reminding us of divides long present in our society; its many sub-communities with their sometimes strongly varied cultural orientations at the micro-level; a few divisions that we have at least partially overcome; as well as those movements that come along now and then to join us together across these lines.It reminds us that we have experienced this multiplicity of issues for a long time.And, we have learned a great deal in the forty or so years since the film was released (and fifty since the stage musical production) regarding identities; intersectionality;[60] and how to draw appropriate lines between respecting the other as a human/Thou/Subject with subjectivity and protecting ourselves as I/Subjects with subjectivity as well – even in the relational moment.For those of us who were raised on the film presented in most adulated form, the message of the humanity of all persons – soldiers included – is inspiring.By contrast, the seedy underside of our cultural debates of the 1960s and 1970s is unsettling, particularly related to issues of sexuality, permissiveness, and a tendency not to protect young people and people not in positions of power and authority.Perhaps we have become more sensitive and sensible about those issues.And perhaps we can look thoroughly at our social and cultural rifts today and find a way to solidarity rather than the sectarianism that newly threatens our generational moment.The key may be to find ways to formulate our overcoming of difference – our treatment of one another as I/Subjects (in humane conscience) rather than It/Others (in radical alterity) – in ways that are sustained and do not reflect only an ephemeral, momentary, or superficial act of dance or theatre troubled by deeper fissures left opaque and yet to be unraveled."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/28/opinion-what-climate-code-red-means-for-africa/,Opinion – What Climate ‘Code Red’ Means for Africa,Mukesh Kapila,Sep 28 2021,"The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) runs into 4000 pages ofgraphs, tables, and closely-argued technical analysis. But it is simply decrypted as signifying code red for humanity. That this is the independent, peer-reviewed consensus of 234 multi-disciplinary experts from every continent, gives it compelling significance. Our earth has heated-up by 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. This is due to human activity, especially greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. The critical 1.5°C threshold agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement will be breached and the devastating 2°C level exceeded by mid-century if current trends are unchecked.Africa is more vulnerableWhat does progressive and significantly irreversible planetary transformation herald for Africa? The continent is warming at a slightly higher rate than the rest of the world and its surrounding sea is rising slightly more than the global mean. Africa’s greater susceptibility comes from small changes accumulating to produce big effects over time.That is heightenedby thecharacteristic of climate change to skew the extremes of normal weather fluctuations i.e. as everywhere becomes hot, warmer places get hotter still. Temperatures in the 40s Celsius are not unusual across Africa while numbers of days at 50C+ have doubled, especially in North Africa. Dry areas are becoming drier and wet areas wetter. Overall, Southern, Western, and Central Africa are expected to get less rain while Eastern Africa would get more.Disaster and developmentvariability manifests visibly through the increased frequency and severity of weather-related disasters. Since the Millennium, disasters have affected at least a third of Africa’s 1.3 billion people.All 54 nations are impacted with Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, and South Africa suffering most. Floods are the commonest catastrophe (64%) but droughts are deadliest (46% of deaths). Other disasters due to heat waves and bush fires are increasing. 38 coastal countries face rising sea levels, inundations of densely populated cities, and ferocious cyclones.Impact on food security is critical. Land productivity is compromised by bio-diversity decline, soil degradation, and locust plagues. Cereal yields are projected to fall by 13% in West and Central Africa, 11% in North Africa, and 8% in East and Southern Africa. Hunger is on the rise; the 250 million under-nourished in Sub Saharan Africa, represent an increase of 45% since 2012.Equally stark are health impacts. Biting insects love higher temperatures and rainfall, allowing vector-borne dengue fever, malaria and yellow fever to flourish. Also increased is epidemic risk from the viral successors to HIV/AIDS and Ebola, consequent to greater animal-human interactions due to ecological changes.Most vulnerable are elders, children, and those with underlying conditions. Higher temperatures dehydrate and affect kidney function. Further effects from air pollution, worsen heart and lung conditions. There are other impacts on skin cancers and allergies, and increased mental illness. Greater pregnancy complications are expected – worrisome in a continent that still has high mother and child mortality. Currently 30% of healthy African life-years are lost from non-communicable diseases;this will inevitably rise.With such profound climate impacts combining with COVID-19, Africa will miss the 2030 targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Recent stock-take indicates millions pushed further into poverty, hunger, and illness. While the continent will recover – belatedly – from the pandemic, the worst of climate change is yet to bite. Hard choices lie ahead as ambitions are deferred towards the distantAgenda 2063 of the African Union.Security risksBut will Africa’s young, growing, urbanizing and fast-educating population accept this calmly? This is unlikely in a continent that is home to around 20 armed conflicts in addition to the political and social violence prevalent almost everywhere.Climate change is a possiblethreat-multiplier:a heat–aggression relationship suggests a 10–20% increase in armed conflict risk for each 0.5°C temperature increase. Two mechanisms illustrate theis competition over climate-affected scarce resources. Water sharing around Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam has raised tensions with Egypt and Sudan. The Lake Chad basin has lost 90% of its surface water putting 30 million people in Nigeria, Chad, Niger, and Cameroon at loggerheads over what is left. Other continents struggling with their own climate impacts are eyeing African resources. China has acquired millions of hectares in DRC, Liberia, Guinea, and South Sudan for export-oriented agricultural, forestry, and mining operations. Oil-rich Gulf states are also big buyers.Disquiet over such “land grab” brews resentment against exploitative national elites and foreigners.Second is climate-driven migration, a survival strategy already adopted by 2 million Africans.Impoverished by ecological shifts and environmental disasters, the rural poor rush to cities. Increased squabbling over already-stressed infrastructure and jobs is a generator of urban violence that blights Africa’s mega cities. Africans are already big migrants but when accelerating climate change starts forcing trans-boundary movements, tensionsbetween African neighbours are anticipated. Meanwhile, the migration of desperate Africans to Europe already dominates wary trans-continental relations.Climate justicehistoric injustice is that Africans have contributed least to climate change.Sub-Saharan Africans constitute 14% of the world but contribute only 7% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. Should they be compensated for the rich world’s past emissions? A parallel is with compensation for the past slavery of Africans. Climate justice also has an inter-generational aspect if the young of today and tomorrow must pay for the older generation’s excesses. How fair is that – especially as Africa is demographically the ‘youngest’ continent?A further ethical dimension complicates future choices for the world’s most under-developed region. Sustainable development in the climate crisis era, means restrictions on what powers it. Should Africa hold itself back and fall further behind, while awaiting greater access to renewable energy and innovative technologies? The continent’s experience of access to COVID-19 vaccines is not encouraging.Developing countries demandclimate justice through solidarity, fairness and prosperity. That means greater emission reduction to achieve the Paris Agreement temperature goals alongside stronger emphasis on helping the poor to adapt. It requires keeping earlier promises to provide at least US$100 billion annually via a Green Climate Fund for developing nations to manage loss and damage from adverse effects of climate change as well as for technology transfer, and resilience and capacity building. Whether the forthcoming Glasgow Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) will deliver this is uncertain.Climate calculation to save the world is a ‘net sum zero’ game in the sense that overall global greenhouse-gas emissions must be capped while funds for adaptation are limited.What will be Africa’s share of both the carbon and fiscal budgets?Pan-African effortIronically, many African countries are actually doing well in developing policies to advance SDG 13 on climate action. But practical results are limited because, like with Covid-19, countries cannot go it alone on climate change. How well the continent does in the climate stakes depends on finding a compelling collective voice. That must also accommodate divergent national interests. These range from the mitigation imperative confronting coal-rich South Africa and petro-power Nigeria on one hand, to the energy-efficiencies needed by wasteful lower-middle income countries like Kenya and Zambia. Meanwhile, urgent investment in adaptation is simply a matter of survival for low-income nations such as Ethiopia and Zimbabwe.The relentless progression of climate change poses an existentialist threat to African peoples. It needs a massive Pan-African effort for which the African Union is the logical body to provide strategic vision and direction. Its strange reticence to proactively shoulder that responsibility is placing the continent at grave risk. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/25/aukus-recalling-legacies-of-anglo-saxonism-and-muffling-the-voices-of-island-nations/,AUKUS: Recalling Legacies of Anglo-Saxonism and Muffling the Voices of Island Nations,Jeffrey Geiger,Sep 25 2021,"On 15 September 2021, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States announced the trilateral security pact developed under a cloak of secrecy known as AUKUS. Though ‘not about any one country’, according to the White House press secretary, it was immediately interpreted as a means to counter China’s influence in the Pacific and to challenge the growth of its military and nuclear capabilities. The pact, designed to help Australia develop nuclear submarines, has been seen as the next step beyond the existing ANZUS agreement between Australia, New Zealand, and the United States – seemingly now swept aside due to New Zealand’s nuclear ban. The announcement came as a shock to some of AUKUS’s closest allies, notably France.As French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian put it, France had received a ‘stab in the back’ with the cancellation of its contract to provide Australia with Attack-class submarines – a deal worth a reported A$90 billion. France withdrew ambassadors from the US and Australia and cancelled the scheduled Franco-British defence summit. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian further hit back at the pact, stating the AUKUS ‘intensified’ the regional arms race and reflected a ‘Cold War zero-sum mentality’. As the political fallout increases, the AUKUS pact threatens to damage western strategic alliances for years to come.A History of Anglo-American Strategic AllianceAUKUS is a new development regarding what is being called the Indo-Pacific region, and marks a new turn in the politics of the Anglosphere. But it also draws on the deep roots of Anglo-American strategic alliances and imperial legacies, which have long worked both to capitalize on and compete with China’s regional influence while sidelining the interests of the nations and peoples of the Indian Ocean and Pacific Oceania themselves.In 1877, Britain’s presence in the Pacific region was consolidated with the creation of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), designed to oversee colonial possessions such as Tonga, Fiji, and the Solomon Islands. US aims at overseas domination date as far back as Abraham Lincoln’s secretary of state William Henry Seward, who envisioned the Pacific as central to the quest for a US ‘empire’ that could gain control of world markets. Though Seward’s wider goals were never realized during his lifetime, shortly after the end of the Civil War he was responsible for bringing both Alaska and the Midway Islands under USscale of the events that took place over an eighteen-month period between 1898 and 1899 took Seward’s ideas to the next level, when the US took possession of Hawai‘i, the eastern islands of Samoa, Wake Island, Guam, the Philippines, and in the Caribbean, Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1898 President McKinley argued: ‘we need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny’.The ‘Weary Titan’ and its HeirsWhile it might seem that British colonial power, already becoming stretched by the late 1800s, would have seen American overseas designs (ultimately resulting in the post-Second World War ‘American Pacific’ era) as dangerous competition, the scenario was more complex. In terms of British attitudes towards its colonial responsibilities, British colonial secretary Joseph Chamberlain’s comments at the Colonial Conference of 1902 can be seen as emblematic: ‘The weary Titan staggers under the too vast orb of its fate. We have borne the burden for many years. We think it time that our children should assist us to support it’.As postcolonial scholar Peter Hulme points out, these colonialist ‘children’ were specifically defined along the lines of linguistic and presumed cultural affiliations. For poet William Watson, writing in 1898, Britain and the US were ‘sons of the self-same race’, united in the task of maintaining the ‘vast orb’ of global imperial order. Indeed some colonial powers, such as France, were seen as troublesome competitors rather than as allies. It was hardly surprising when a rumour circulated in 1907 that the United States wanted to buy Tahiti from France for five million dollars in the interests of bolstering the American presence in the region.These rivalries were reinforced in the manifestation of imperial Anglo-Saxonism and the idea of a higher order of ‘English-speaking peoples’. Hulme observes that this privileged category was promoted in the writings of Teddy Roosevelt (the first volume of his The Winning of the West was titled ‘The Spread of English-Speaking Peoples’) and was a sentiment still perpetuated after the Second World War in Winston Churchill’s A History of the English-Speaking Peoples.Projecting a ‘New Imperialism’In 1898, John R. Procter, serving on the US Civil Service Commission, prophesied a ‘New Imperialism’, praising the systems developed by ‘Teutonic ancestors’ as models of social organization, and finding them regenerated in US imperial aims. Procter summed up the American imperial acquisitions with characteristically inflated rhetoric: ‘The year 1898 will be one of the epoch-marking years in the history of the United States. In this year is to be decided the great question of whether this country is to continue in its policy of political isolation, or is to take its rightful place among the great World-Powers, and assume the unselfish obligations and responsibilities demanded by the enlightened civilizations of the age’. For pro-imperialists, the issue went beyond politics to claim moral and cultural superiority for Anglo-Saxon and English-speaking peoples. Procter wrote: ‘from the blood of our heroes, shed at Santiago and Manila, there shall arise a New Imperialism, replacing the waning Imperialism of Old Rome; an Imperialism destined to carry world-wide the principles of Anglo-Saxon peace and justice, liberty andrepresented as a benevolent global mission, expansionism was underpinned by explicit political and economic motives. For example the watershed year of 1898 would also see the founding of the American Asiatic Association, with its mission of working to ‘foster and safeguard American trade and commercial interests’ (lobbying to protecting US trade routes across the Pacific). In 1899, the Association’s Secretary swept aside prevailing messages about a ‘civilizing mission’ in the Pacific and offered a blunter analysis of the US annexations of 1898: ‘had we no interests in China,’ he noted, ‘the possession of the Philippines would be meaningless’.Casting Aside Island Nations and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW)With AUKUS, the US-British so-called special relationship takes a new turn in promoting post-Brexit ‘Global Britain’ military and policy aims. It also reinforces a broader definition of a strategic regional construct – the Indo-Pacific – that overrides a notion of ‘Asia-Pacific’ while cementing Australia’s strategic centrality and its links to western world powers, and effectively squeezing China out of the regional imaginary. At the same time, the pact returns us to prevailing nineteenth and twentieth-century conceived alliances between ‘English-speaking peoples’. These allied peoples were meant to take responsibility for the dominance of global waters while spreading ‘Anglo-Saxon peace and justice, liberty andremains largely absent in this longstanding political and cultural jockeying for power is an understanding of the Indian Ocean and Oceania not as defined by China and the superpowers of the West, but as constituted of maritime flows and what Fijian writer Epeli Hau‘ofa called ‘our sea of islands’. The island nations and peoples of these vast oceanic stretches should be seen as the primary stakeholders and decision makers in these processes.Many of these island nations – The Comoros, Maldives, Seychelles, Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, New Zealand, and others – underpinned the international Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), which came into force only at the start of 2021, and speaks not only to the future of the planet but to a history of nuclear testing and population displacement by western powers in overseas island territories.ConclusionAUKUS might be seen not just as undermining the interests of nations such as France or as a strategic counterbalance to Chinese power, but as an elision of the island nations of the Indian Ocean and Oceania – not only in decision-making processes regarding security and defence, but in defining regional affiliations and identities themselves. The TPNW alliance has been working to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the interest of the survival of the signatory nations and that of the globe itself, but AUKUS appears determined to run a sword through these efforts."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/24/towards-a-better-understanding-of-the-underlying-conditions-of-coups-in-africa/,Towards a Better Understanding of the Underlying Conditions of Coups in Africa,Muhammad Dan Suleiman,Sep 24 2021,"On Sunday, 5 September 5 2021, news broke of a coup in Guinea. An elite group in Guinea’s military had ousted the country’s president of eleven years, Alpha Condé. The usual condemnations flew in as many Guineans jubilated in the streets. The African Union and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) expelled Guinea and imposed sanctions. The latter froze financial assets and placed a travel ban on the putschists. Guinea’s coup is one of many recent cases of the army intervening in national politics, after many African countries are expected to have significantly democratised, post-Cold War, from the early 1990s. This has alarmed democracy watchers, and analysts are binging – with an air of surprise – on why coups are making a comeback or rising in the continent. This question, however, assumes that the conditions that fueled “old” coups left the continent in the first place.A tale of many – or different? – coupsAfrica led in coups between 1950 and 2010, accounting for 36.5% of all coups globally. According to one report, since the first coup in Togo in 1963, there have been over 200 coups and attempted coups in Africa. In each decade between 1958 and 2008, West Africa, designated as a “coup-belt”, had the highest number of coups in the continent, accounting for 44.4%. Condé’s ousting is one of four coups and attempted coups in the sub-region in less than nine months – after two coups in Mali (September 2020 and May 2021) and one attempted in Niger (March 2021). These figures take the continental count to nine coups and 29 attempts since 2010, excluding the attempted coup in Sudan few days ago.The number of coups has however reduced. There has been an average of two coups since 2019, a decline from an average of four between 1960 and 2000. This statistic suggests an improvement, but it also shows that military takeovers in Africa are a present danger. Many of the recent coups have the DNA of old coups. Of much concern, however, are cases of “coups that are not coups”. They come in the form of “soft coups” as happened in Zimbabwe in 2017, “dynastic coups” as happened in Chad last April, and the so-called “constitutional coups”.The last involves elongating constitutional term limits by sitting presidents. Instead of getting access to power by crushing through the gates of governments from the outside, these “different” coups entail negotiating one’s way to power, including through legal means, and staging a “coup” from the inside. These coups appear to have a higher probability of success since they are staged from a position of relative or ultimate power. They seem to hurt democratic sensitivities less. Hence they are more “acceptable” by the international community. They are not accorded, at least overtly, the seriousness to which old coups areGuinea, there are at least 14 countries in which sitting presidents have tampered with constitutional terms to stay longer in power, in just a little over a decade. In another five, sitting presidents have attempted, but failed, to do so.Africa’s “democracy”: one step forward, two steps backMuch of the analyses point to recent coups as returning on the heels of African democracies in reverse gear. However, this line of argument seems to accept that neoliberal democracy in Africa made a forward move, in the first place – a move significant enough to prevent coups from happening again. There are enough reasons to say otherwise. Noam Chomsky suggests in Who Rules the World that we live in the same ugly world merely punctuated by one historical moment after another. Imperial and corporate interests largely survive across these moments. Despite the move from Cold War to post-Cold War, and recently to post-9/11 politics, it appears not much has changed in Africa’s domestic and global politics.Claims of democratic progress in Africa are overrated. Despite some emergent developments in the right direction, a more accurate picture of democracy in the continent is that of one step forward, followed by two back. In one assessment, for example, researchers conclude that democratisation in Africa between 1990 and 2010 saw progress but also setbacks. It found democracy in the continent to be ‘increasingly illegitimate’. Within that period, there were regular elections but also democratic rollbacks; democratic institutionalisation but also endemic corruption; institutionalisation of political parties but also widespread ethnic voting and violent politics; increased number of civil societies but also local realities of incivility and violence; and political freedoms and economic growth but also political controls and inequality.A survey of voting intentions in 16 African countries found that, in countries with few dominant parties, voters preferred certain parties to avoid post-election retribution. Another study concludes that,(political) succession in African states indicate trends towards illegitimate and unpopular self-succession, hereditary trends, the appointment of proxies and only a few instances of emerging liberal democratic regimes.Across the continent, one of the world’s leading democracy researchers, Emmanuel Gyimah-Boadi, finds that,the exercise of authority enjoyed by presidents and their appointees effectively negates the voice of the people, as expressed via elections, print and electronic media, and even lawsuits.He adds that the proportion of Africans who believe they live in a democracy falls almost every year since mid-2000. The Ibrahim Index of African Governance shows that democratic progress in Africa is below citizens’ expectations. There is also a decline in people’s trust in key institutions. These may be problems that a more consolidated democracy could eventually address. However, they also represent an affront on the validity and desirability of current democratic principles in the continent.The above account of democracy in the continent, for example, raises many questions. One of which is whether democracy should be assessed against qualitative indicators, like the actual substance of popular participation and suffrage, and not against quantitative benchmarks alone – such as the sheer number of publicinstitutions, regular elections and voter turnouts. Arguably, the above offers a general overview of democracy, and specific country cases may present better or worse cases. And, as Nigerian Political Scientist Claude Ake noted some 20 years ago, ‘Africa is by no means the only part of the world where the prospect of democracy is in question’. His observation is accurate even now as democracy in the world is said to be backsliding.Yet, for the most part, neoliberal democratic project in Africa was largely an external imposition in the image of post-Cold War politics.Some three decades later, the fate of that project requires a rethink to suit local circumstances, irrespective of the prospects of democracy elsewhere. Moreover, history seems to show that political developments in Africa are better not analysed in silos, but from the vantage point of the sum of the continent’s position in worldprying eyes of external powersConditions that motivated old coups were not only found in national politics. The prying eyes of external interests were ferociously at work. In the first four decades of independence, coups were set against destructive Cold War politics. The twoglobal powers, the Soviet Union (now Russia) and the United States (U.S.) raced against each other for space and resources on the continent. African elites were appropriated into that politics to do the bidding of global powers. The results were many coups, and glorified dictators. Given that history, and the observation that shifting global orders do not necessarily bring significant changes in international political and economic behaviour, external interests cannot be absolved in recent coups.According to one report, sources in the Malian army confirm that putschists who removed Mali’s President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita spent most of the year training in Russia before returning to force out the elected leader. Russia is also mentioned in the second Malian coup in nine months, which saw Assimi Goita become interim leader of the Sahelian country. These facts do not conclusively implicate Russia, as Goita and several participants in the latest Malian mutiny also received U.S. training and assistance. Still, they raise questions about whether the coups are attributable to domestic politics or, as some say, to foreign interests.Just like we see in Libya and other places, Russian mercenary groups, for example, appear to play a deeper role in conflicts on the continent than meets the eye. Connections have been drawn between these so-called private groups and the activities of Russia and France in Mali, and between Russian mercenaries and conflict in the Central African Republic.Any Russian geopolitical success in Mali is a loss for the country’s former colonialist, France. For instance, while the latter criticised the military junta in Mali, it supported the dynastic coup by Mahamat Déby in Chad.Francophone Africa has a not-so-impressive reputation regarding coups. Between 1958 and 2008, most coups in Africa occurred in former French colonies. Owing to many former French colonies opting for neo-colonial ties to France, the Elysée cannot be ruled out as influencing, if not sponsoring, many of these coups.As Jonathan Holslag maintains, China’s strategy in Africa is more about adapting to political realities than shaping them. Yet, the Guinea coup has been analysed by some as being orchestrated by the U.S. to neutralise China, whose trade with Africa has increased 40-fold over the past two decades. The U.S. is also circumstantially implicated in the coup as a video showed some American soldiers celebrating the fall of Condé. Coup plotters also left a base where they received U.S. training and headed for Conakry immediately before the coup.All these may not be conclusive evidence of external influence or sponsorship. The U.S., for instance, has flatly denied any involvement in the Guinea coup. However, add the above circumstantial evidence of foreign interference, to contemporary events in Africa’s relationship with the external world since the slave trade, and what you have is an almost unambiguous answer: recent coups in Africa have foreign fingerprints.The above position does not reduce African agency into lump of soft wax for external actors to mould into shape. Rather, it restates a fact of history in which foreign interests have attempted, and mostly succeeded, in doing the moulding. Global powers, for instance, are currently repositioning in the context of the “new Cold War” between Beijing and Washington, as U.S. and allied influence in the continent wane. As global powers reposition themselves in Africa as part of the so-called “new scramble”, they appear to be continuing the Cold War practice of subcontracting external interests to national elites who could grab power, or cling toway forwardAs Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni writes, whatever happens in Africa must be understood in the context of ‘the entire modern world system and its shifting global orders’. Why coups are (re)occurring in any part of Africa must thus be assessed against prevailing conditions on all levels of the international system. Whether one looks at the issue inwardly (towards national politics) or outwardly (towards global politics), the structures and motivations behind coups have not changed much. The conditions that incited old coups are still present. Only that they now operate in a different post-9//11 and, perhaps, Covid-19 historical moments.On the one hand, democracy has not made much progress in national politics as to prevent a return to authoritarianism in the continent. On the other, and consequently, foreign interests are at play, as always. Subsequently, national leaders are (still) circumventing the cosmetic democratic structures present in their countries. Global powers are (still) using their every advantage to shift goalposts in their favour. For example, in Mali and Guinea, rich deposits of minerals like Uranium, Iron Ore, and Bauxite are among the obvious trophies.Contrary to one argument, therefore, African leaders are not ‘the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend’ of recent coups. The coup in Guinea will not be the last – indeed, there is another attempted a few days ago in Sudan! – unless African countries qualitatively democratise, and global powers rethink their centuries-old tradition of shaping and shaking African spaces in their favour.Stopping coups in Africa will also require Africa to take charge of truly decolonising the continent. That should involve answering hard moral questions about coups, including whether they are all necessarily bad as the dominant view suggests. Or they could be understood as “good” liberatory political statements against dictators or abuses of constitutional power, especially in the face of the functional incapacity of intergovernmental bodies such as ECOWAS, in the case of West Africa, to prevent incumbent abuses.National, sub-regional and continental bodies must also redefine when a coup is coup. Currently, a coup is an illegal attempt to unseat a sitting leader by military or civilian officials. This definition must be stretched to include all actions – hard or soft; whether within incumbent regimes and governments or not; and whether they are from a position of power or not – to unseat a leader or take power in a condition of a political vacuum. The effective application of this comprehensive definition, using relevant punitive legal, political and diplomatic instruments, could forestall future coups. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/23/opinion-us-artillery-crusader-is-out-what-is-next/,"Opinion – US Artillery: Crusader is Out, What is Next?",Robert Palmer,Sep 23 2021,"The XM2001 Crusader was a dead-end from the start, it just took a few years for the US army to face the facts. Obscenely pricey, so bulky it was unmovable, chock-full with technology ill-adapted to modern-day battlefields, the Crusader fell victim to what often happens in US Army procurement: billions of dollars poured into a stillborn project. So, has America learned its lesson?America’s military hegemony was conceived during World War Two, and consecrated during the Cold War. The frantic stockpiling of weapons at this time made it, de facto, the most lethal country in the world – neck and neck with the Soviet Union. Consequently, the only conventional wars which the US has known, in its relatively short history, are struggles against large forces, be they German, Japanese, or Russian. In this type of strategic and tactical setting, immense howitzers, such as the Crusader, would have been suitable, despite its lack of mobility and accuracy: when facing large bulky forces, blunt firepower will often do.Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said in 2002, after having made his decision to cancel the program, “we need joint integrated approaches to battlefield challenges. We need weapon systems capable of producing the precise and timely destruction of enemy targets.”He said the effectiveness of the Crusader, which had no prototype, is a topic that has been under study for five or six years. “It’s not something that is a new debate.” So, what was wrong with the Crusader?In the post-Cold War era, the US has been facing a new type of enemy, and is slowly realizing that the game has indeed changed. Be it in Somalia, Afghanistan or post-war Iraq, US forces have been finding themselves increasingly helpless, despite systematically superior firepower, in tactical situations. Small, nimble, insurgent enemy units have reverted the guerilla strategy which the US used during the war of independence, against US troops. Against this invisible, constantly moving enemy, articulated in ultra-small formations, a howitzer such as the Crusader is nearly useless. War reporter Scott Shuger writes:Rumsfeld’s official justification for the move was that the 40-ton Crusader wouldn’t be able to keep up with the tanks and fighting vehicles it was designed to protect. While it might have been a terrific weapon for the set-piece battles it was designed for—against massed Soviet forces in the flats of Central Europe—the Crusader figured to be of dubious use in short-lead-time maneuver warfare in faraway mountainous places like Afghanistan.Its size and weight bars it from quick air deployment, its tracked configuration means that insurgents will find a safe haven in mountains, where tank-type vehicles cannot go, and its slow speed means that it would systematically be one step behind its targets. Since the turn of the century, warfare has changed. The goal is now to reach a balance between mobility and firepower, so as to adapt the US forces to their new enemy – and the US knowsthat it has become clear in which strategic direction US Army procurement needs to drift, it has started looking at alternative equipment, within the armed forces of its neighbors. Israel, France and China all have opted from artillery systems mounted onto truck chassis, which provide increased tactical mobility and deployability.The Israeli Atmos howitzer is used by Tzahal, with good results. It is not to be excluded that the US Army would purchase some Atmos guns, if only given the strong diplomatic relations between the US and Israel. However, the equipment is not all that is at stake in this matter. Behind a vehicle lies a doctrine, and the US needs to find inspiration from nations with expeditionary armies – which rules out both China and Israel. The Atmos is a good gun, but it has only been used in homeland defense, so there is no way of knowing how well it fares in overseas deployments.Although it is highly unlikely the US will ever purchase its weapons from China, the US will probably observe the results of the PLC 181 with a keen eye, as it does seem to fit the American bill, on paper at least. Also mounted on a truck chassis, it is easily transportable by air, and may eventually be used in the Himalayas, in the simmering confrontation with India.But the model which seems the most suitable source of inspiration for the US may be the French Caesar howitzer, which comes both in 6×6 and 8×8 configurations. The vehicle has been deployed in operations in Mali and Afghanistan, with excellent results. Because the Caesar has the proper configuration for modern-day warfare, is battle-proven, and can fire all of the advanced ammunition which the Americans use, the US army has included it in its latest market review. Janes reporter Victor Barreira writes:Nexter’s CAESAR 6×6 will participate in an upcoming US Army shoot off against other 155 mm self-propelled howitzers […] The air-transportable CAESAR 6×6 has a combat weight of 17,700 kg, length of 10 m, a width of 2.55 m, can travel up to 50 km/h off-road speed, and is manned by five soldiers.To American dismay, war is not simply about having the biggest gun, it’s about having the right gun. The Crusader was larger in every way, on the modern armament market, but would have been utterly useless in today’s theaters of operations. Donald Rumsfeld took flak for having dropped the curtain on the program, after 11 billion dollars had been spent. But, had he not, the US would have lost far more, and all of the strategic edge which artillery provides. It is becoming increasingly likely that the US army will resort to howitzers more similar to the French artillery, in the very near future. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/21/turkeys-role-in-syria-a-prototype-of-its-regional-policy-in-the-middle-east/,Turkey’s Role in Syria: A Prototype of its Regional Policy in the Middle East,Shaimaa Magued,Sep 21 2021,"Turkish policy toward Syria has gone through different phases since the declaration of the Turkish Republic in 1924. Yet, Syria has always been the main sphere of Turkey’s regional role in the Middle East. Geographical proximity, shared history, and common security issues have shaped the evolution of bilateral relations and Turkish regional conduct toward either conciliation and rapprochement or tension and military encroachment. By sharing common borders of nearly 900 km, Turkey and Syria have engaged in permanent interactions that influenced the balance of power in bilateral relations and the security dilemma in the Middle East.Historical Background on Turkish-Syrian RelationsNot only had Turkey the balance of power in its favor throughout the Cold War period and the 1990s but also regional dynamics were dominated by power politics, notably antagonist military alliances involving Western countries and Israel vis-à-vis Arab countries. Although the Turkish-Syrian difference was instigated by bilateral conflicts over the region of Hatay/Iskenderun, the repartition of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the Kurdish issue, Arab countries expressed solidarity toward Syria on the bilateral level and within regional instances such as the Arab League and the Organization of Islamic Conference. Egypt alongside Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, and Gulf countries have always condemned Turkish policy toward Syria and limited cooperation with Turkey to the economic level.During the 1970s and 80s, Turkish economic ties were limited to three Arab countries, namely the United Arab Emirates, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. On the other hand, Turkish initiatives of economic cooperation involving Arab countries and Israel were conditioned by the positive development of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (Aykan, 1993; Mouawad, 2001). In light of Turkey’s regional projects within its alliance with the US, Arab countries have rejected to take part in some, notably the water pipeline projects that involved Israel, unless the latter would reach a positive agreement on Palestinian rights with the PLO.Mistrust has dominated the perception of the Turkish regional role in the region as a result of its antagonistic conduct toward Syria. The Syrian support for the PKK fighters as a pressure card for getting a better agreement over water rights was met with Turkish engagements into military and strategic alliances with the US and Israel in the region. The 1980s and the 1990s witnessed Turkish alignment with the US policy in the Middle East, notably vis-à-vis Iran and Iraq in addition to its conclusion of a series of military agreements with Israel in 1996 and 1997. Turkey’s comparative advantage in military capacities vis-à-vis Arab countries has culminated with the mobilization of military troops on common borders with Syria in 1998 which prompted the al-Assad regime to stop its support for the PKK fighters thanks to an Egyptian mediation that facilitated the conclusion of subsequent bilateral agreements on the security and politicalpolicy toward Syria under the JDP Rule (2002–2010)Although Turkish rapprochement with Syria was initiated by the military establishment and supported by the secular ruling elite at the time, the inauguration of the Justice and Development Party to power in November 2002 has paved the way for the start of a new chapter in bilateral relations. Turkish policy toward Syria continued to incarnate a prototype of a new Turkish regional policy in the Middle East. In line with the JDP’s regional vision based on economic rapprochement, zero problems with neighbors, multidimensionality, and proactivity, Turkey initiated an active policy toward Syria. Frequent official visits have introduced multiple agreements toward political, economic, security, and technical cooperation through the High Council for Strategic Cooperation that was then emulated with Turkey’s neighboring countries. Both countries agreed to develop areas of common interests, multiply trade relations, notably across borders through the creation of twin cities and the increase of investments in vital Syrian industries, and to adopt a cooperative approach in the management of the Kurdish and water issues.The increase of bilateral trade with Syria following the elimination of visa requirements between both countries as a medium for overcoming bilateral tension was replicated throughout the region with Arab and Caucasian countries. Claims over the Hatay/Iskenderun region, disagreement over water repartition, and mutual mistrust over the Kurdish issue have no longer been dominant factors in shaping bilateral relations since they were bypassed by several areas for cooperation on the economic, political, technical, and strategic levels such as the elimination of visa requirements with Syria, technical cooperation over the management of the Tigris and Euphrates’ water, and the Free Trade Agreement in 2004 (Aras, 2009; Magued, 2019).Writings have shed light on structural and normative transformations in Turkish policy toward Syria as a manifestation of a real change in Turkish regional role and policy toward neighbors on the discursive and practical levels (Magued, 2019; Mahfuz, 2012; Aras, 2004; Davutoğlu, 2010). Turkish openness toward Syria highlighted an official shift toward the adoption of a friendly and positive discourse toward Syria and Arab countries with a focus on areas of common interests rather than issues of disagreement. This change in Turkish attitude has unlocked the regional security dilemma that persisted until the end of the 1990s. With the JDP’s incarnation of a political and economic role model for Arab and Muslim countries, it has been orientated toward the multiplication of business ties and political coordination among neighbors and between the latter and superpowers, notably the US and the EU. This security shift in Turkish regional policy from material threats to areas of complementarity and cooperation among neighbors came in response to the Turkish adoption of European harmonization packages at the beginning of the 2000s as a condition for starting membership negotiations.Additionally, Turkish rapprochement toward Syria presented an unprecedented channel of communication between the al-Assad regime and its allies (Iran, Hamas, and Hezbollah) from one side and the West (notably the US and the EU) from the other. Turkish-Syrian relations introduced the first step toward the sociopolitical and economic normalization of the Middle East and its normative integration into the global order. This step was concretized through mediation between resilient authoritarian leaders like al-Assad and the Iranian regimes from one side and Israel and the European Troika from the other, the improvement of the Syrian economic infrastructure, and the reconciliation of its political worldview with Western powers on various issues, notably the progress in peace negotiations and the alleviation of the Syrian resistance stance vis-à-vis the West.The Shift in Turkish Policy toward Syria and Its Repercussions on its Regional Role in the Middle EastAlthough the JDP has initiated a successful rapprochement toward Syria, the Arab uprising, notably the protests that erupted in Deraa in March 2011 and prompted security concerns to come to the fore in bilateral relations and disturb regional dynamics. The reemergence of the threatening nature of the Kurdish factor has alarmed Turkey of domestic political developments in Syria. Breaking with the personal friendship that developed between al-Assad and Erdoğan, the JDP’s call for immediate political reforms in Syria has increased tension in bilateral relations and propelled Turkish military intervention in bordering regions since 2012. Starting from 2011, the Turkish hard power approach toward Syria presented a prototype of the JDP’s role in the region. Turkey’s policy was marked by a series of military operations in Syrian and Iraqi cities in its fight against the PKK elements that were empowered by the emergence of a Syrian Kurdish Front and the Kurdish government in Northern Iraq.adoption of a confrontational and nationalist line in Turkish policy toward Syria that focuses on the limitation of the PKK infiltration across borders and its political-strategic empowerment in Syria and Iraq has tainted Turkey’s regional role and relations with neighbors into a Hobbesian outlook. Turkey’s former economic partners in Gulf countries have expressed their opposition to Turkey’s policy in Syria and supported the current Egyptian regime following the ousting of the Muslim Brothers’ post-revolutionary government. Also, the Kurdish government in Northern Iraq expressed its opposition to the presence of Turkish officials and troops in Iraq and Syria. Similarly, Egypt alongside Gulf countries perceived Turkish intervention in Libya in support of Fayez al-Sarrag’s government as an issue of national security that would disturb its Western borders’ stability and order. In response to Turkey’s military presence in northern Syria, notably Idlib in coordination with Russia, Egypt has excluded Turkey from the East Mediterranean Gas Forum initiative that overlooked Turkish strategic interests in maritime borders’ demarcation with Greece and Cyprus (al-monitor, 2020; emgf.org).ConclusionSyria has always been geostrategically important for Turkey in the formulation of its regional policy and role toward neighbors. The nature of bilateral relations has depended on the management of common issues of contention that constituted an impediment toward rapprochement in the 1980s and 1990s and tainted the Turkish regional role with a hard power approach in the Middle East. The JDP’s success in the introduction of a conciliatory diplomatic framework based on the development of areas of common interests with Syria has enabled its diffusion among neighbors. However, the eruption of the Arab uprisings has interrupted the conciliatory course of bilateral relations and disturbed the normative framework of Turkish diplomacy in theAras, B. (2004).

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/21/a-totalitarianism-of-our-time-what-arendt-tells-us-about-environmental-injustice/,A Totalitarianism of Our Time: What Arendt Tells Us About Environmental Injustice,Carly A. Krakow,Sep 21 2021,"Is environmental injustice so widespread, and are its impacts so damaging, that it can be understood as a totalitarianism of our time? When a child in Flint, Michigan becomes poisoned by lead and suffers lifelong neurological damage because of a governmental decision to alter the city’s water source, how would policy responses be improved if lawmakers recognized that this devastation means the ‘right to have rights’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, 296–297) has been lost? When a resident of Detroit, Michigan is left stranded like a ‘refugee in the city’ (to quote Detroit activist Monica Lewis-Patrick) because of government water shut-offs, how severe and disenfranchising do the effects have to be for lawmakers to acknowledge environmental racism causes ‘“de facto” stateless[ness]’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, 279)? In Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley,’ health destruction is a widespread reality because corporations weaponize minority communities’ perceived invisibility by placing toxic industrial sites dangerously close to their homes. Could law—local, national, and international—be deployed to challenge environmental injustice if we accepted that communities are effectively ‘banish[ed]’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, 444) from society when incapacitating health impacts negate community members’ abilities to participate in public life?The questions posed above illuminate how Hannah Arendt’s work, particularly 1951’s The Origins of Totalitarianism, offers a novel approach to understanding environmental injustice and the climate crisis. Arendt’s work, long prominent in the human rights and political theory canons, became the subject of additional, intense public interest following former US President Donald Trump’s 2016 win and ensuing authoritarian approaches to governance. (Sales of Origins surged, climbing to sixteen times higher than usual.) Although Arendt’s work remains central in discourse about rights, there has not been sufficient attention paid to what she offers for an original understanding of environmental injustice. Arendt’s work helps us to grapple with deficiencies regarding local and international policies on environmental injustice and environmental racism. Environmental injustice is, I argue, a totalitarianism of our time. Local environmental injustice and the global climate crisis will have totalitarian impacts on the same communities—and must be addressed as linked phenomena—in order to develop just, decolonial, and equitable environmental and climate policies. Arendt helps us to understand environmental injustice and the climate crisis—and what actions to take.The ‘Right to Have Rights’ at Local and Global ScalesIn Origins, Arendt discusses her concept of the ‘right to have rights,’ explaining that there is only one human right that matters: the right to belong to a political community in which we gain access to all other supposedly universal rights promised in international declarations. In essence: citizenship. Arendt explains how ‘loss of home and political status become identical with expulsion from humanity altogether’ ([1951] 1968, 296–297).Governments and corporations practice environmental racism by withholding resources from and forcing toxic exposure on minority communities, stripping communities of the ‘right to have rights’ and exploiting cases where the ‘right to have rights’ is already absent. In Origins, Arendt writes about the horrific treatment of displaced survivors of World War II as a failed test case for the international human rights system. Writing in the mid-twentieth century, she was not, of course, commenting on the plights of climate refugees fleeing sea-level rise, residents of cities experiencing unprecedented rainfall and flooding, or people in California, Turkey, and Australia fleeing some of the worst wildfire seasons in history. Nor was she commenting on the water injustice that has plagued Flint and Detroit, or the large number of people worldwide whose forced exposure to toxins is so severe that it must be understood aswhat I call ‘toxic saturation.’ These situations demonstrate, however, the relevance of the ‘right to have rights’ to environmentalcases where environmental injustice means ‘powerlessness’ (and, I argue, resistance to powerlessness) ‘has become the major experience of [people’s] lives’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, vii), it is entirely possible to be in possession of one of the world’s most ‘powerful’ citizenships, in a developed country such as the United States, while still being reduced to rightlessness and de facto statelessness. Due to space confines, this article focuses on the US context. In other writing I explore how Arendt’s work helps us to understand environmental racism worldwide, including under occupation in Palestine and in post-apartheid South Africa.The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted Black, Latinx, and Indigenous communities in the United States. Air pollution is linked to higher COVID death rates. Systemic environmental racism means that the populations that have faced the highest COVID death tolls are the ones already living in fenceline communities near pollution-emitting sites, breathing in toxic air, being deprived of water, and coping with inequitably insufficient healthcare access. These living conditions make these communities some of the most vulnerable to the pandemic and the climate crisis. Most recently, as of August 2021, ‘Cancer Alley’ was devastated by Hurricane Ida. Residents of communities such as St. James parish, already battling toxic industry expansion, are now threatened by crude oil spills and chemical leaks in the wake of the storm.Rebecca Solnit argues, regarding gender-based violence, that the failure to treat systemic violence as ‘a crisis, or even a pattern’ (2014, 21) fuels that violence—an argument that also applies to environmental injustice. The loss of the ‘right to have rights’ anywhere challenges the validity of the international human rights project everywhere. Ignoring a crisis—a glaring pattern—is pouring gasoline onto that crisis’s flames. Environmental injustice has a global pattern, as reports of poisoned water pop up in numerous places worldwide beyond Flint, and as toxins such as lead, other heavy metals, and chemicals sicken and kill people from Philadelphia to Iraq to Nigeria. And yet, media reports often treat these incidents as isolated—rarely as systemic environmental racism fueled by industries responsible for injustice that is both short-term and long-term, and both local and global.An Arendtian approach reveals that environmental injustice is a contemporary ‘totalitarian’ force—a force that strips people of their ‘right to have rights’ and leads to de facto statelessness whereby people maintain their citizenship, but are without rights in practice. Like the totalitarianism of Arendt’s time, environmental injustice can only be combatted once local episodes are recognized not as isolated instances, but as interconnected, strategic cases of subjugation that are linked with the climate crisis and other struggles for justice. As Margaret R. Somers argues, writing about victims of Hurricane Katrina, ‘stateless citizens’ are ‘socially and morally excluded—invisible, dispensable, and forgotten. Human beings treated in this way become surplus, not worthy of social or moral recognition by others’ (2008, 114). Environmental injustice is distinct from the totalitarianism of Arendt’s time, but she offers essential insights for understanding how environmental injustice functions in the contemporary era. Environmental injustice alters existing understandings of totalitarianism and citizenship.Environmental Racism in the United StatesIn some cases, the link between local environmental racism and climate injustice is clear. ‘Cancer Alley,’ comprised of predominantly Black, low-income communities, suffers high cancer rates due to a large number of toxic industrial sites. Diamond, Louisiana, one affected community situated between a Shell/Motiva oil refinery and Shell chemical plant and the former ‘epicenter’ of a slave rebellion (Lerner 2005, 13), was simply, Steve Lerner writes, ‘not a place where most people would choose to live’—a place where people have suffered illnesses including cancer, asthma, and skin disorders from toxins and, in the 1970s and 1980s, ‘mourned neighbors and friends killed by explosions at these facilities’ (2005, 9). The same industry fueling the climate crisis uses communities’ perceived invisibility because of racism and economic discrimination to pollute with a low risk of attracting external concern, making residents’ ‘right to have rights’ meaningless. Diamond residents demanded Shell buy their homes at fair prices to fund relocation. Ultimately, in 2002, Diamond’s residents won—a ‘bittersweet victory’ because by moving to safety, they lost their physical community and left Diamond ‘another fenceline ghost town’ (Lerner 2005, 284). There are numerous communities in the US South suffering from shocking environmental racism. In Reserve, Louisiana, for example, the risk of cancer is fifty times the nationalother cases, the link between local environmental racism and climate injustice may be less immediately apparent but is just as critical. In 2014, the City of Detroit disconnected 33,000 households from water for inability to pay (and has disconnected tens of thousands more since 2014). The shut-offs were ultimately recognized by three UN special rapporteurs as a human rights violation, placing political pressure on the city to reduce shut-offs without legal authority to enforce an end to shut-offs (Krakow 2020). (For a brief discussion of Detroit and the ‘right to have rights,’ albeit not in the context of environmental justice, see 2018’s The Right to Have Rights (DeGooyer, Hunt, Maxwell, Moyn).) Catarina de Albuquerque, who at the time was the Special Rapporteur on the human right to water and sanitation, visited Detroit, noting, ‘I heard testimonies from poor, African American residents … who were forced to make impossible choices—to pay the water bill or to pay their rent.’Years of environmental racism in Detroit, a majority-Black city, set the stage for residents to be without sufficient water and at greater risk during the pandemic. Environmental racism has also made residents more vulnerable to the climate crisis because of inequities regarding water access, healthcare, and infrastructure.On the shut-offs, Monica Lewis-Patrick, President and CEO of We the People of Detroit, commented, ‘For many people, it’s … like you’re a refugee in the city because of the imminent threat.’ As ‘refugee[s] in the city’ of a developed, wealthy country with democratic governance, the experiences of Detroit residents demonstrate this article’s concept that local environmental injustice is powerful enough—totalitarian enough—to render citizens de facto stateless while they are still de jure citizens.Flint, Michigan, a city of 100,000 people, was collateral damage in 2014 when governor-appointed ‘emergency managers’ usurped elected officials, leading the city to switch to a less expensive water source amid a financial crisis, exposing residents to toxic lead and causing an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease that killed twelve and sickened at least ninety. The unrecognized number of ill is believed to be much higher. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state and city officials knew and withheld information. Arendt’s conception of totalitarianism as a force that dispossesses people of the ‘right to have rights’ reveals how, on local and international scales, totalitarian systems deem people dispensable, prioritizing economic gain for the elite. This cycle of prioritizing financial interests over civilian safety—particularly the safety of minority communities—follows the same template as governmental justifications for delaying meaningful action on climate change. This pattern of ‘sacrifice’ aligns with racism laid bare by the COVID-19 pandemic and calls to risk lives for the sake of the economy during the pandemic, an approach advocated for by Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.An Arendtian approach crystallizes why we must stop de-linking local disasters from global climate injustice. Both local environmental injustice and global climate injustice, at different scales and speeds, lead to a common result: depriving people—regardless of their de jure citizenship status—of the ‘right to have rights.’ In an era of environmental injustice, one need not be literally deprived of ‘home and political status’ to be ‘[expelled] from humanity’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, 297). A person can retain citizenship, but be so profoundly affected by environmental injustice that they are rendered, in most ways that matter, de facto stateless.‘Banished’ by Environmental InjusticeOn exclusion as a step en route to tyranny, Arendt writes, ‘Banishment banishes only from one part of the world to another part of the world, also inhabited by human beings; it does not exclude from the human world altogether’ ([1951] 1968, 444). Environmental injustice has devastating impacts on health to the extent that people are effectively ‘banished’ from the system of laws and protections that purport to ensure that vulnerable populations not only have basic rights, but live with dignity. This state of ‘banishment’ applies not only to people Arendt recognizes as lacking the ‘right to have rights,’ including refugees, but often manifests in its most insidious form in cases where rights are enshrined legally through citizenship, but are denied in practice—even if people are not physically forcibly relocated. People affected by environmental injustice can be made just as rightless as displaced people or victims of a totalitarian society. This is evident in Iraq, where years of forced toxic saturation caused by the US military have left civilians trapped and without the ‘right to have rights.’Agamben describes the refugee as the ‘unique figure’ who enables us to ‘perceive the forms and limits of a political community to come’ (1995, 114). Environmental injustice reveals the citizen as a figure who stretches the bounds of de facto statelessness to include communities like those in Flint, Detroit, and ‘Cancer Alley.’ This figure—the citizen subjected to environmental injustice—enables us to ‘perceive the forms and limits of a political community’ already in existence, but severely deformed regarding basic rights protections. Like the stateless person Arendt or Agamben describe, environmental injustice leaves the citizen unable to turn to either the state or humanity to claim the ‘right to have rights.’‘Legal identity does not guarantee a good life, but its absence is a serious impediment to it,’ writes Jacqueline Bhabha (2011, 1). Those officially lacking ‘legal identity’—stateless persons—are deprived of basic rights, such as access to safe air and water. People with legal citizenship who exist on the furthest margins of society—or are abruptly pushed beyond the margins, as in Flint and Detroit—are made de facto stateless by environmental injustice, although they maintain citizenship and are technically members of a powerful, sovereign state.Robert D. Bullard, leading environmental justice scholar and advocate, defines environmental justice as the principle that ‘all people and communities are entitled to equal protection of environmental and public health laws and regulations’ (1996, 493). This article demonstrates that environmental injustice is so severe as to require that de facto statelessness be recognized as a too commonplace or inevitable consequence of environmental injustice. De facto statelessness caused or worsened by environmental injustice is ‘not the exception but the rule,’ to quote Walter Benjamin ([1968] 2007, 257).Members and StrangersOn twentieth-century genocide, Arendt writes, ‘When no witnesses are left, there can be no testimony’ ([1951] 1968, 451). Systemic racism has made it possible for governments and corporations to enact environmental injustice while counting on communities’ subjugated positions as assurance that there will be no ‘witnesses’ to provide ‘testimony.’ Community organization and activism reject these unequivocally false, racist assumptions. Community actions against environmental injustice in the US and worldwide have proven these racist tactics ultimately ineffective in countless cases including in Flint, Detroit, Diamond, St. James, and in the cases of Indigenous resistance to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.Even when community members bear ‘witness’ and speak out to give ‘testimony’ about environmental injustice, governments and the private sector often turn this visibility against them, positioning them as ‘witnesses’ who are not sufficiently credible to provide valid ‘testimony’ of their experiences. In Flint, residents began speaking out months before city officials acknowledged the crisis, but their complaints were ignored. Now Michigan’s former governor Rick Snyder finally faces prosecution, years after contaminated water first began flowing into Flint homes.Seyla Benhabib notes, ‘Democracies should be judged not only by how they treat their members but by how they treat their strangers’ (1998, 109). Environmental injustice necessitates a reconsideration of how we define the bounds between ‘member’ and ‘stranger.’ Environmental injustice requires that we evaluate international systems and states by how they protect, or fail to protect, ‘strangers.’ Estranged citizens of states unable or unwilling to defend citizens’ rights must be recognized as part of this ‘strangers’ category. As Arendt writes,The conception of human rights … broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who … lost all other qualities and specific relationships—except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human ([1951] 1968, 299).Arendt makes clear that totalitarian forces ‘banish’ people from the realm of rights protections. As the examples discussed show, environmental injustice possesses this same dangerous power. No matter how systematic, however, environmental injustice does not necessarily emanate from a single authoritarian or totalitarian movement or figure.In On Violence, Arendt writes, ‘Bureaucracy is the form of government in which everybody is deprived of political freedom, of the power to act; for the rule by Nobody is not no-rule, and where all are equally powerless we have a tyranny without a tyrant’ (1970, 81). The idea of ‘tyranny without a tyrant,’ when applied to environmental injustice, reveals a system of injustice and racism so ingrained that it does not require a single catalyst. The culprit might be the government at the city and state levels (Flint and Detroit) or the federal level (Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines), or a corporation (Shell in Diamond), or a combination of all these forces. The commonality is that when the ‘right to have rights’ is violated locally, the repercussions are inevitably global. This is because 1) a loss of rights locally undermines the validity of international human rights protections; and 2) a loss of rights locally due to environmental injustice makes that same local community profoundly vulnerable to the global climate crisis, and other global challenges—most recently the COVID-19is essential to note the rich body of literature complicating and critiquing Arendt’s work. Kathryn T. Gines (2014) provides a key analysis of racism in Arendt’s work, and Ayça Çubukçu (2020) addresses Arendt’s approach to race and civil disobedience. Çubukçu importantly notes Arendt was not ‘immune from the racism of her time’ (2020, 48) and was ‘profoundly limited’ by the notion that the United States ‘is an exceptional land of freedom and democracy’ (2020, 33). A discussion of these critiques in their own right is necessary, but beyond the scope of this article. Here, however, it is worth noting not only how Arendt’s work changes how we understand environmental injustice, but how the analysis of environmental injustice reveals insights—as well as gaps and flaws—in Arendt’s writing. Acknowledging this enables Arendt’s theories to be applied in new ways, at times transcending the limits of the time in which she was writing.Injustice That is ‘Global in its Political Aspiration’: Can International Law Ameliorate Environmental Injustice?Can environmental injustice be viewed, like totalitarianism, as a force that is ‘global in its political aspiration’ (Arendt [1951] 1968, 389) because of the extent to which the contemporary capitalist context promotes the exploitation of natural resources at the expense of some humans? And, if the loss of the ‘right to have rights’ in countless local contexts demonstrates the ineffectiveness of international law, what is international law’s future role in the fight against environmental injustice? Although international agreements are a fundamental component for coping with the climate crisis, examples discussed here demonstrate why accountability on a local scale, and policies driven by local communities, are essential for genuine environmental justice and protection of the ‘right to have rights.’ On this point, there is a poem by the nineteenth-century writer Stephen Crane (1899) that offers a fitting sentiment:A man said to the universe:“Sir, I exist!”“However,” replied the universe,“The fact has not created in meA sense of obligation.”Crane’s provocation can be interestingly applied to thinking about international law. Environmental injustice might suggest that international law is an indifferent universe refusing to truly recognize the existence of its suffering human subjects. Alternatively, is international law the lone figure that Crane describes, begging to be recognized, in a ‘universe’ of politics and international relations that does not feel obliged to respond to international law’s demands for protection of humans and the environment?B.S. Chimni argues, ‘international law is the principal language in which domination is coming to be expressed in the era of globalization’ (2003, 47). Antony Anghie poses the questions, ‘What does it mean to say that “international law governs sovereign states” when certain societies were denied sovereign status?’ and ‘What continuing effects follow from this exclusion?’ ([2004] 2007, 7). Anghie also writes, ‘sovereignty was improvised out of the colonial encounter’ ([2004] 2007, 6). As I have written regarding denial of the human right to water, contemporary manifestations of environmental injustice are, in many cases, examples of the ‘continuing effects’ of excluding certain groups from sovereign status—excluding them from citizenship, and by extension, from international law. Environmental injustice’s dominance in marginalized communities is connected to historical patterns. A community need not be legally denied sovereign status, at present, in order to suffer from the harms Anghie describes. ‘Legacies of colonialism, slavery, and apartheid persist, even if communities formerly subject to illegality have since been granted legal status’ (Krakow 2020).Arendt writes that propaganda is central to totalitarianism but ‘always makes its appeal to an external sphere—be it the nontotalitarian strata of the population at home or the nontotalitarian countries abroad’ ([1951] 1968, 342). Can strategic efforts to ignore or mask environmental injustice locally, such as the government and EPA concealing dangerous lead levels despite residents’ documentation in Flint, be understood as propaganda in an Arendtian sense? The fossil fuel industry’s propagandistic efforts to deny and under-report its impacts on climate helped stall action on climate change. These forms of propaganda contribute to environmental injustice as a totalitarianism of our time.Can international law itself be seen as ‘propaganda’? When there is a proliferation of non-enforceable treaties, do these developments propagandistically produce an appearance of international legal action to mask a reality ofwas interested not only in the process by which totalitarians come to power, but also in the aftermath of totalitarian devastation. The biggest climate threats loom ahead as environmental disasters including unprecedented flooding, wildfires, and droughts are rapidly becoming more severe and frequent. What can reading Arendt tell us about not only how all-encompassing environmental and climate injustice have emerged and dominate our lives, but about how we can combat these injustices and imagine living through climate emergency?Arendt’s conceptions of the ‘right to have rights’ and totalitarianism show us that in order to live through the climate crisis while centering environmental justice, we must recognize that environmental injustice experienced locally is never divorced from global climate injustice. International law, and international human rights, only have meaning when justice is achieved locally. Community experiences and voices must be centered to drive policies on environmental injustice. This is the way forward for addressing rightlessness and de facto statelessness caused by environmental injustice, and the way forward for combatting environmental injustice as a totalitarianism of our time."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/17/explaining-bipartisan-support-for-the-us-innovation-and-competition-act/,Explaining Bipartisan Support for the US Innovation and Competition Act,Benjamin Smith,Sep 17 2021,"The US Innovation and Competition Act (ICA) authorises $110 billion for technological research to allow the United States (U.S.) to better compete with China. It began life as the initial Endless Frontier Act (EFA), which was put forth to congress by Democrats Ro Khanna and Chuck Schumer during the Trump administration in 2020. The act aimed to authorise $110 billion to a new technology directorate at the National Science Foundation (NSF) (double the NSF’s traditional funding) (Vox, 2021). Although initially rejected during the Trump administration, Khanna and Schumer put forth the act again during the Biden administration in 2021. Since the act was posed to receive bipartisan legislation, ‘Schumer threw it into the traditional Senate process, letting it work through committees and get marked up by lawmakers’ (Vox, 2021). These negotiations resulted in the bill transforming into the ICA. The senate expanded the bill to include ‘loosely related’ expenditures and ‘rolled NSF’s existing funding into the $100 billion, cutting the amount of actual new funding by about half’ (Vox, 2021). Following these amendments, the bill passed with bipartisan support.However, the ICA’s bipartisan support is exceptional, since the U.S. is otherwise highly polarised. While seemingly inexplicable, this article finds that Democrats and Republicans have shared ideological motivations for said support. Although they have otherwise conflicting partisan ideologies, Democrats and Republicans ideologically converge in opposition to China’s authoritarianism. The result is that there is bipartisan support for the ICA because it promotes competition with China. Understanding this bipartisan support is of both scholarly and political importance, since Democrats and Republicans are highly polarised over almost all other policies and should thus be unlikely to cooperate over foreign policy.Nevertheless, conflicting partisan ideologies remain evident throughout negotiations. Democrats advocate expenditures in a variety of sectors and tend to criticise China for being authoritarian – rather than communist. Conversely, Republicans prioritise military expenditure over all other sectors, and explicitly criticise China’s communist ideology as a threat. Republicans also often utilise bipartisan negotiations to push their partisan agendas. They do so by claiming that policies implemented under prior Democrat administrations weakened the U.S. and thereby, enabled China’s rise. These conflicts illustrate that smaller, partisan ideologies continue to remain active within a shared, bipartisan anti-authoritarian ideology. Thus, although ostensibly a bipartisan effort, partisanship still occurs during negotiations over foreign policy toward China.Klein describes polarisation in American politics as group division ‘over fundamental identities that tend[s] to generate intolerance and hostility’ (2020: 43). Heltzel and Laurin found that ‘polarization recently reached an all-time high in the U.S. […] across all issues’ (2020: 179).Given this, it is unclear as to why Democrats and Republicans then provided bipartisan support for the Biden administration’s ICA (CNBC, 2021). This unexpected bipartisan support even extends to the electorate, wherein the general American public expresses support for the Biden administration to ‘promote human rights in China even if it harms economic relations between the two countries’ – regardless of their party alignment (PEW Research, 2020). For context, the American public is otherwise highly polarised along party alignment (PEW Research, 2020). To clarify this unexpected bipartisan support, this article poses the following research question: why is there bipartisan support for the Biden administration’s ICA aimed toward China?To answer this question, I examine statements from Democrat and Republicans to identify potential motivations for their bipartisan support. In addition, I seek to identify how and why they may diverge in their ostensibly bipartisan support. Data sources for my analysis comprises of U.S. Senate Congressional Reports and various news outlets.Perspectives on the presence (or lack of) domestic polarisation over U.S. foreign policy differ. At the advent of the Cold War, Republican senator Arthur Vandenberg famously stated that the US must stop ‘partisan politics at the water’s edge’ (Senate.Gov, 2020). Nevertheless, the ‘water’s edge’ thesis has been questioned as studies have continually shown that ‘bipartisanship in foreign policy has broken down […] since the end of the Cold War’ (Jeong and Quirk, 2019: 59; McCormick et al, 1997; Marshall et al, 2001; Parent et al, 2008). Furthermore, post-Cold War studies have found that partisan ideologies often shape foreign policy decision making (Khong 1992; Kaarbo 1997; McDermott 1998; Schafer and Crichlow, 2002; Keller, 2005; Renshon 2008). To identify the specific ideologies that now shape partisanship over foreign policy, I turn to Gries’ framework of small i and big I ideologiesdistinguishes dominant American political ideologies into a ‘“big L” Liberalism and ‘“small i”’ partisan ideologies (2014: 33; 35). Big L liberalism refers to a bipartisan ideological belief that ‘seeks to maximize individual freedom’ and thus ‘sets the boundaries of the thinkable in American foreign policy’ (Gries, 2014: 33). As a result, this bipartisan liberal ideology ‘ensures that Americans will always be wary of tyrannies of any guise, whether fascisms and dictatorships of the right or communisms of the left’ (Gries, 2014: 33). Conversely, small i ideologies are those that result in ‘differences in [partisan] worldviews [and] foreign policy preferences […] within the overall constraints of a shared “big L” Liberalism’ (Gries, 2014: 33-34). The most dominant small i ideological differences within the U.S. are between liberals and conservatives. Such differences include liberals being ‘much more supportive of spending on social welfare programs than conservatives, while conservatives [are] much more supportive of spending on national security programs’ (Gries, 2014: 41-42). Throughout the following analysis, I will illustrate how these opposing small i ideological preferences remain active throughout foreign policy negotiations – despite a bipartisan concern for China’s authoritarianism.Adopting Gries’ theoretical framework, I thus predict the following: bipartisan support for the ICA is due to a shared big L liberalism ideological belief that China’s authoritarianism is a threat. However, partisanship still occurs throughout negotiations since small i ideological differences (liberalism and conservatism) remain active.To identify why bipartisan support occurred, I turn to my previously outlined theoretical framework. Partisan ideologies took causal primacy throughout negotiations. While Democrats and Republicans evidently have opposing ideologies (i.e., regarding governmental expenditures, foreign intervention etc), they also share a negative view of authoritarianism (Gries, 2014: 34). As elaborated on later, Democrats and Republicans equally describe China’s authoritarianism as a threat to both U.S. homeland security and the ideological survival of democracy. Both parties emphasise that the U.S. must match China’s overall increases in power to maintain homeland security (albeit, with Democrats and Republicans differing on which sectors expenditure should be prioritised on) (Foreign Affairs, 2021) Similarly, there is bipartisan concern that China’s authoritarianism will displace the established, American-led liberal democratic order (Foreign Affairs, 2021). Biden himself described the U.S.-China rivalry as part of a greater ‘“contest with autocrats”’ over ‘“whether democracies can compete […] in the rapidly changing twenty-first century”’ (Foreign Affairs, 2021).Admittedly, it is debatable as to how committed either Democrats or Republicans are to the defence of democracy. A large portion of the Republican party continues to provide support for prior President Donald Trump’s unconstitutional actions, failed to condemn the anti-democratic 2021 storming of the U.S. capitol and perceive the 2020 election result as illegitimate (BBC, 2021). Likewise, the Biden administration claims to uphold a democratic international order, yet fails to provide support for poorer democracies in the Global South (Foreign Affairs, 2021). Regardless, both Democrats and Republicans still describe foreign authoritarian states as threatening and thereby, ideologically converge in opposing China. Thus, bipartisan support can be credited to shared anti-authoritarian sentiments overriding otherwise conflicting partisan ideologies (Gries, 2014: 34). In other words, “the enemy of my enemy is my friend”.Nevertheless, differences in how the parties approach negotiations illustrate that partisanship still occurs within this ostensibly bipartisan support.Democrats advocated for expenditures in a variety of sectors for the ICA. These sectors include climate change mitigation, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing, student scholarships and other areas of technological and scientific innovation (Vox, 2021). Democrat senator Jon Ossoff stated that since ‘China [is] steadily investing in their own semiconductor manufacturing […] the United States needs to compete, and in order to do so, we need to pass this essential funding’ (Congress.gov: S2774). Ossoff claimed that attempting to manipulate the issue for partisan gain is pointless, as it only expands wage requirements and thereby impedes manufacturing expansion: ‘Imposing additional costs on the construction of these advanced fabrication facilities […] actually expands the role of prevailing wage requirements because this is essentially private construction, funded in part […] by U.S. Federal tax dollars. So now is not the time to let politics get in the way of our progress.’ (Congress.gov:Republicans prioritised military expenditure over all other sectors during negotiations for the act. Republican senator Jim Inhofe argued that the bill ‘is not doing anything in terms of the military that we are suffering under right now’ (Congress.gov: S2774). Inhofe and other Republicans put forward an amendment to ‘make sure that any increase in nondefense, discretionary spending will be matched by the same level of increase to the defence spending’ (Congress.gov: S2774). Inhofe attempted to present this amendment as a bipartisan effort, claiming ‘this is not something that is just Republican. This is something that was agreed upon some 10 years ago by Democrats and Republicans’ (Congress.gov: S2775).Yet, in the same speech, Inhofe criticised the Obama administration having ‘reduced the budget for defence by 25 percent [while] [d]uring the same timeframe, China had increased theirs by 83 percent’ (Congress.gov: S2775). In doing so, Inhofe implicitly blamed China’s rise on the Obama administration’s reduction of defence investments. Inhofe then went on to criticise President Biden as ‘not willing to make the [defence] investment we need’ (Congress.gov: S2775).Other Republican senators echoed Inhofe’s sentiments regarding military expenditure. Tommy Tuberville argued that ‘the President’s skinny budget is disappointing [and] a disservice to our men and women in uniform’ (Congress.gov: S3920). Rand Paul criticised the bill’s expenditures in non-defence related sectors, going as far as to describe the National Science Foundation as ‘one of the most wasteful agencies in government’ (Congress.gov: S3916). Paul described these expenditures as contradictory to combating China, since government-funded research is a tenant of socialism: ‘We complain about Chinese socialism, which is the government running everything a spending all of the money. So, what are we going to do? The same thing […] We are going to have government-directed research, to which we will all say: “Oh, socialism isn’t good, but the government directed this”’ (Congress.gov: S3916). These comments reveal that the Republican party’s predominately anti-socialist, conservative small i ideology remains a motivating factor during negotiations (Gries, 2014: 42). While seemingly a bipartisan effort, partisan conflict over expenditure priorities is thus apparent throughout the negotiations.Partisanship is further apparent when examining how Democrats and Republicans differ in describing China’s ideological threat. Democrats, including Biden himself, tend to criticise China only for being authoritarian, rather than communist or socialist (Foreign Affairs, 2020). Senator Chris Van Hollen described China’s authoritarianism as an ideological threat to democracy, emphasising ‘the importance of democracy overseas’ and to ‘criticize China, rightly, when it begins to snuff out the right to vote in Hong Kong’ (Congress.gov: S3405). While discussing competition over 5G technology, Senator Mark Warner criticised China’s monitoring practices as a reflection of its authoritarian ideology and thus, incompatible with the U.S.’s democratic values: ‘We are suddenly seeing China flood the zone with these standard-setting bodies, and when you set the standards, you also reflect your values. So, values that we bring to the table, like transparency and respect for human rights, go out the window when China sets the rules around 5G that basically allow traffic to always pass-through Beijing. Even if you are making a phone call between St. Louis and San Francisco, why does that traffic have to be routed through Beijing unless there is a malicious interest at stake?’ (Congress.gov: S3188). Democrats thus consistently describe China’s authoritarian practices as an ideological threat to the U.S.’s democratic regime, but do not tend to criticise China’s communist or socialist ideology.Although Republicans similarly denounce China’s regime for being authoritarian, they also tend to explicitly criticise China’s communist or socialist ideology as a threat. Senator Joni Ernst put forward an amendment to prevent ‘providing additional U.S. funds to subsidize any state-run lab in China’ so as to ‘ensure that not another dime of taxpayer dollars goes to subsidizing Communist China’ (Congress.gov: S3409). While criticising China’s soft-power influence over U.S. universities, Senator Dan Sullivan stated that ‘censorship, oppression, and one-sided thoughts are characteristics of Communist China, not America, and 1certainly should not be the characteristics of America’s great universities’ (Congress.gov: S3477). Senator Mike Lee similarly claimed that the U.S. ‘cannot meaningfully compete with Communist China’ so long as the U.S.’s federal regulatory system continued ‘costing the American economy $2 trillion the American economy $2 trillion’ (Congress.gov: S3493). Lee’s comments are particularly revealing, since he simultaneously targets China’s communism and advocates a key tenant of conservativism: the reduction of government expenditure (Gries, 2014: 42). As a result of their party’s dominant conservative small i ideology, Republicans consistently address China’s communism or socialism as threatening (Gries, 2014: 42). Thus, despite bipartisan support for the ICA, partisan ideologies remain active throughout negotiations.It should be noted that there are select ideas which are shared across parties during negotiations. Since the initial introduction of the EFA, Democrats and Republicans alike have appealed to America’s national identity and history to mobilise bipartisan support.The initial bipartisan supported bill claims: ‘For over 70 years, the United States has been the unequivocal global leader in scientific and technological innovation […] Today, however this leadership position is being eroded and challenged by foreign competitors’ (Congress.gov: S2597). Republican senator Tuberville cited the U.S.’s identity as a global hegemon while identifying the threat that China poses: ‘It is no secret that the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, wants to replace the United States as the world’s top power.’ (Congress.gov: S2535). Republican senator Todd Young similarly appealed to the U.S.’s global significance, claiming that China is ‘locked in a global competition with this great nation’ (Congress.gov: S23841). Democrat senator Maria Cantwell also referred to America’s identity as a leader and its expansionist history when discussing the nation’s need for technological and scientific innovation: ‘We are a nation of people who know how to innovate, who know how to use science to transform our economy, and we have done it over and over and over again […] Maybe it came with, in getting in a boat and coming all the way across the ocean, you had to be an adventurer to begin with.’ (Congress.gov: S2573). These appeals to American national identity and history are thus a tactic employed across parties.The influential legacy of the Trump administration is also evident in both parties. Republican senators explicitly encourage maintaining policy decisions from the Trump administration.In reference to Trump’s halting of the Thrift Saving Plan’s investment in companies with ties to the CCP, Tuberville claimed that ‘we need congressional action to make President Trump’s decision with the thrift savings plan permanent’ (Congress.gov: S2537). It should be noted that Tuberville was amongst the Republican senators who attempted to overturn Biden’s electoral victory. Tuberville’s desire to retain policy decisions from the Trump administration is thus part of a broader partisan view that the Biden administration isinfluence of the Trump administration is also observable within the Democrats – albeit less directly. The preceding Democrat Obama administration generally pursued a less competitive foreign policy toward China (Christensen, 2009: 28). The successive Republican Trump administration initiated a strategy of hegemonic competition with China: most notably in the form of a trade-war (Schweller, 2018: 37). Despite polarisation over the Trump administration’s trade war, Democrats have nonetheless become more hostile toward China, and the Biden administration has thus continued a strategy of hegemonic rivalry. The Trump administration thereby shifted the ideological spectrum for both parties toward pursuing hegemonic competition with China.Yet, these select shared ideas between parties are relatively exceptional. As I have illustrated above, it is partisan small i ideological preferences that have predominately shaped negotiations (despite operating within a bipartisan big L liberalism ideology) (Gries, 2014: 42). Therefore, although there is ostensibly bipartisan support for the ICA, partisanship remained active throughout negotiations.To conclude, the ICA received bipartisan support due to both parties perceiving China’s authoritarianism as an ideological rival. Nevertheless, their smaller, partisan ideologies remained active within this shared, bipartisan anti-authoritarian ideology. The result is that partisanship occurred throughout negotiations and substantially altered the contents of the act. While other ideational factors (including appeals to America’s national identity and the legacy of the Trump administration) held some influence, partisan ideologies ultimately took causal primacy throughout negotiations. Looking forward, scholars and policymakers should more closely examine the complex dynamics of ideologies within foreign policy – rather than assume it is solely bipartisan or partisan.BibliographyBBC News. 2021.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/14/the-international-political-economy-of-health-the-covid-19-vaccine-distribution/,The International Political Economy of Health: The Covid-19 Vaccine Distribution,Mohid Iftikhar,Sep 14 2021,"The relationship between international politics and global health issues is not coming of age. From the nineteenth century, states have had various interactions at the system structure due to health epidemics and infectious diseases such as Cholera, Small Pox, Typhus, andYellow Fever, and Scarlet Fever and the Bubonic Plague. It was during the mid-nineteenth century when the International Sanitary Conference of 1851 took place, leading the European States for a multilateral approach towards quarantine regulations. In turn, with regional and international trade and development coupled with globalization, health professionals and governments started recognizing the threat of contagion and chaos from such diseases. The 20th century had also its fair share of similar pandemics and infectious diseases such as the Spanish Flu, Polio, HIV and Legionnaires’ disease and Lyme disease. By the mid-twentieth century with the inception of the World Health Organization (WHO), global institutional mechanisms came in place, hence binding a common consensus of international health crisis by both the global north and south.First appearing in the Chinese city Wuhan in late 2019, by March 2020 Covid-19 was declared as a global pandemic by the WHO. During Covid-19’s early onset, little was understood about the virus. Simply, countries due to their capacity, cultural, social, political, and economic factors varied in their responses to Covid-19. Some countries had tighter policies towards Covid-19 such as social distancing, contact tracing, lockdowns, identifying asymptomatic individuals, testing kits/methods and halting international and domestic travel, whereas some countries including the US quashed Covid-19 as nothing more than a myth.The IMF (2020) noted that,the Great Lockdown (is) the worst recession since the Great Depression, and far worse than the Global Financial Crisis…cumulative loss to global GDP over 2020 and 2021 from the pandemic crisis could be around 9 trillion dollars.It became evident in mid-2020 that the Covid-19 pandemic was one of the worst catastrophes of the 21st century. According to WHO estimates, 4 million people had died due to Covid-19 worldwide by June 2021. Subsequently, with the development of Covid-19 vaccines, new debates have emerged in the international political economy (IPE). Borrowing from Susan Strange’s (1988) theoretical premise of four primary structures in IPE; security, production, finance, and knowledge, this piece aims at establishing linkages to understand the distribution of the Covid-19 vaccines.Interaction of Finance, Knowledge, Production, and Securityglobal distribution of Covid-19 vaccines can be viewed from complex interactions between finance, knowledge, production, and security structures. A web of processes such as institutions, spending, research, investors, capacity and manpower, and technological innovation determine the diffusion of medical breakthroughs. In essence, the complex dimensions of power both material and normative determine factors of production, output, and distribution.Firstly, unequal distribution of global health (spending, research, infrastructure, and innovation) is not novel. In 2018 five leading global powers, constituting 9% of global population; France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States accounted for 60% of global health spending. However, in terms of the average health spending per capita in 2018; low-income countries had an average of US $40 whereas high-income countries had an average of US$3,313. Furthermore, health spending patterns vary across high-income, upper-middle-income, low-middle income, and low-income states. The primary sources of health spending are public, households, private insurance, external aid, and a relatively small number of workers receive health benefits at private organizations. For example, in 2018, lower-income countries health spending through external aid was 30%, the household was 41% and public sources was 21% whereas, in lower-middle-income countries, the same spending was 42%, 10%, 40%. However, in high-income countries, public health spending (including social insurance) was 70% and in high middle-income countries, public health spending (including social insurance) was 55%. In addition, the general trend for low-income countries has been an increase in external aid from 2000-2018 and declining public and private health spending. Hence, concerning global health spending patterns, for the developing world, easy and affordable access to medical resources remains restricted. Moreover, the weak and fragmented health structures in poor countries are bolstered through political decay, corruption, patronage networks, vested interests, and lack of accountability and this further adds to the intricacies for the masses to access basic health resources.Second, the development of vaccines has long remained a techno-medical issue. It is the years of research, innovation alongside technological advancement, and testing that determine the success, effectiveness, and market roll-out. Historical lessons provide us that under normal conditions, vaccines take at least a decade or even more to develop. For example, scientists started working on the polio vaccine in the 1930s; however, it was 1953 when polio vaccine became completely effective. In comparison, due to the global pressures, the Covid-19 vaccine took a year to develop. As rightly stated by Brüssow (2021), regarding the Covid-19 vaccine “what normally takes a decade was worked out within a year.” According to one study, during the early trials of vaccine development the estimated cost was said to be approximately US $31-68 million and with further advancements this number is set to increase. In addition, the challenges for developing vaccines do not pertain to only medical research, but there are institutional-bureaucratic challenges and financial constraints. In the US, only numerous institutes such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) along with others had to partner in developing the vaccine.Third, it remains vital to understand the link between international corporates and global health governance and how they shape intellectual property (IP) regimes. According to the IDEA Pharma twin indexes—“the Innovation Index and the Invention Index”, the top leading R&D pharmaceutical companies have their origins primarily in the US, Western Europe, and Japan. Some of these corporates include Eli Lilly (US), Roche (Swiss), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (US), Seagen (US), Incyte (US), and GSK (UK) and Sanofi (France), and AstraZeneca (UK & Sweden) and Novartis (Swiss) and Johnson & Johnson (US) and Eisai (Japan). It is vital to note that Multinational Corporations (MNCs) influence does not stem only from their sheer value of global revenues, but also their ability and capacity to innovate and invent drugs and to politically influence domestic and international institutions. Sell and Williams (2019) argue that “capitalism is an all-encompassing global phenomenon that interacts with health at multiple scales and via a range of ‘vectors’ that must be engaged, examined andthe late 1970s, developing countries focused upon cultivating their indigenous pharmaceutical industries for harnessing affordable socio-economic and health benefits, but this faced strong resistance from the Western MNCs. For example, American pharmaceutical companies were able to utilize their domestic institutions to protect pharmaceutical products under the patent product with the inception of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1994. TRIPS was legally binding by all WTO members. This novel regime placed new arrangements of robust intellectual property checks (patent protection) towards the developing world for accessing affordable medicine. In consequence, IP severely impeded generic producers in the developing world and truncated their capabilities to resist constraints by institutional structures. For example, noted in an article of BMJpreviously, the two companies with a duopoly for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine held patents that prevented competition. According to one estimate, low income countries paid up to 10 times the estimated cost of production for these vaccines. Millions of girls globally are still unable to access this critical protection against cervical cancer.Subsequently, the emerging patterns of governance in the 1990s led transnational NGOs to strengthen and extend support to the developing world’s generic pharmaceutical producers. In consequence, this also allowed pharmaceutical giants to channelize new strategies for protecting their products. The new IP regime reinforced the protection of clinical trials as well as limiting counterfeit drugs. According to Roemer-Mahler (2012),The IP issues involved in data exclusivity and the debate on counterfeit drugs, namely undisclosed information and trademark protection, are assuming increasing importance for R&D-based pharmaceutical companies at a time when patents are becoming less effective as tools to mitigate competition.This was because new drugs under IP had a time frame and once that lapsed, generic companies had an opportunity to significantly gain by starting their production and selling much cheaper drugs in their domestic markets. In addition, R&D-based companies also confronted an economic dilemma, as they were unable to bring new drugs into the market along with facing patent expiration of their products.Fourth, by end of June 2021, there have been “around 180 potential vaccines…in preclinical development by pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, and government agencies.”However, the vaccine development lead rests in the ambit of a few states such as: the US (Johnson and Johnson, Moderna & Novavax), China (CanSino, SinoPharm, Sinovac), Russia (Gamaleya, Vector Institute), and consortia between the UK and Sweden (Oxford-AstraZeneca) and the UK and Germany (Pfizer-BioNTech) and India (Bharat). Moreover, other than WHO’s emergency use listing (EUL) of Covid-19 vaccines, the global acceptance, and distribution remain with Western states and to some degree with Russia and China. Haggart (2017) rightly states that “It is not an exaggeration to state that knowledge and its communication have become a primary vector for the exercise of power in the global political economy.”What is alarming is that by May 2021 only 2% of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in world’s 50 poorest countries. One study of the British Medical Journal notes that countries in the Global South are constrained by the intellectual property law in accessing Covid-19 vaccines and this only aggravates global inequalities. Such IP constraints and financial disparities depict impediments for the developing world to access Covid-19 vaccines in a timely manner.According to the WHO Director-General “I need to be blunt, the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world’s poorest countries.” Despite COVAX, a global co-led venture between CEPI, Gavi, and WHO, and delivery partner UNICEF; there has been a significant failure for the vaccines to reach the world’s poorest. “Covax hasn’t failed, but it is failing,” according to Dr. Ayoade Alakija, a co-chair of the African Union’s vaccine delivery program. Assistant Director-General of the WHO notes “you can’t distribute vaccines that you don’t have.” And by July 2021, “more than 80% of the doses have gone to people in high-income and upper-middle-income countries. Only 1% of people in low-income countries have been given at least one dose, according to the website.”is also important to note that structural constraints such as export restrictions by the US, EU, and India on vaccines and their ingredients alongside hoarding and little cooperation for knowledge have equally exacerbated addressing Covid-19 vaccine needs of the developing world. The US secured contracts for 1.3 billion Covid-19 vaccines, 5 per citizen. Whereas Canada secured 65 million Covid-19 vaccines and sought another 120 million. Similarly, the UK had deals for securing 500 million Covid-19 vaccines – 8 per person; and Australia, for its 25 million population, secured 170 million Covid-19 doses. Interestingly, at the height of the Cold War and despite being competitors, the Soviet Union and the US cooperated to eradicate smallpox through global vaccination program, and this only points to the deepened fractures in the core structures of IPE today.ConclusionThere is an urgent need to advance new scholarship that explores how global policies are shaped for the distribution of important vaccines such as Covid-19 and HPV and particularly why the developing world lags at the receiving end. For a robust and in-depth theoretical understanding, the complex interaction of security, production, finance, and knowledge structures of IPE allows exploring the linkages between markets, governments, researchers, INGOs, societies, and MNCs and how their varying interests collide. In relation, drawing upon Susan Strange’s (1996) argument of examining IPE problems beyond the conventional political and economic domain provides a strong model for causal precision. And primarily because today with the free-market system, global linkages and technological advancement, stakeholders such as MNCs seek to promote and reinforce their interests. This piece in no way seeks to conclude which structure of IPE takes precedence in cause-and-effect relation of Covid-19 vaccine distribution. Rather it points to global health spending patterns, the time frame of vaccine development, interests of global pharmaceuticals, and their strategies embedded in international institutions as well as highlighting constraints in global health diplomacy. While countries such as China have taken a lead in Covid-19 vaccine diplomacy, more effective strategies such as flexible IP regime, interest free financing and checks on hoarding are in need for the developing world to have an equitable access.History provides us important lessons about the global cooperation on common threats, as during the Cold War when the Soviet Union and the US worked together to eradicate smallpox. However, today we must account for the complex composition of regional-multipolar systems as rising and regional powers compete for resources. Moreover, due to the liberal market system, increasing number of actors such as scientists, investors, manufacturers, governments, NGOs, international institutes are at constant play for security. It is seemingly a black-box problem to explain policy processes. This is where the epistemological and ontological foundations of political science in conjunction with the ongoing theoretical development and innovation of IPE reinforces a path to solid social inquiry.

Choksy and Carol E. B. Choksy,Sep 13 2021,"Taking a swipe at the Taliban’s newly-announced interim government of terrorists and criminals, Iran’s semi-official Mehr News Agency critiqued: “The Taliban … have repeatedly alleged they would form an inclusive government.” Given the Taliban’s current approach to governance, experts in Tehran at the Strategic Council on Foreign Relations, that advises Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warn “relations between Iran and the Taliban or the government formed by the Taliban will not be amicable.” During July and August, as Iran’s executive branch transitioned from the presidency of Hassan Rouhani to that of Ebrahim Raisi, the government in Tehran began adapting to new realities on its eastern front. After two decades, the US can no longer use Afghanistan to strike Iran but the restoration of Taliban rule there does not bode well either. In the estimation of many in Tehran’s government and most of the Iranian public, takfīrīs or militant Sunni extremists are controlling Afghanistan again. It is not just the Taliban that Iran finds troubling but also the new Afghan regime’s longstanding partner Al-Qaida plus units of Da‘ish or the Islamic State—two more terrorist groups with which Iran has clashed—that have begun entrenching in Iran’s eastern neighbor. So, Iran is working to safeguard its internal security and regional influence.Past Problems, Present RealitiesOn 8 August 1998, Taliban forces who are followers of Deobandi and Wahhabi Sunni Islam, captured the Afghan city of Mazar-i Sharif and massacred fellow Muslim Shiites including ten Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist. Iran deployed troops along its eastern border, demanded United Nations Security Council (UNSC) action against Afghanistan’s Taliban government, declared an annual commemoration day, and even produced a movie about its citizens’ “martyrdom” at the hands of Takfiris. As the Taliban retook Afghanistan in August 2021, the Iranian foreign ministry called again for a full accounting of that “cowardly” attack.When the Taliban’s return to power became inevitable, Tehran shuttered its consulates at Afghan cities like Herat and Mazar-i Sharif and drew down its staff at the embassy in Kabul to avoid deaths as occurred in 1998. Moreover, Iran’s foreign ministry insisted the Taliban must “seriously respect the security of diplomats and diplomatic centers in accordance with international conventions”—despite the Islamic Republic having held American diplomats hostage in Tehran for 444 days four decades ago.Former leaders of the Islamic Republic have drawn upon past tensions to warn their nation and neighboring countries that the Taliban are “going to be serious threat to all of them.” Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the outspoken sixth president of Iran from 2005 to 2013, has led the charge, telling all who will listen: “India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, China and regional countries will face the consequences of the re-emergence of Taliban.” Masih Mohajeri, a veteran cleric and news editor close to the Supreme Leader, cautions that “masks (of deception) will be dropped … as they (the Taliban) will violate all pledges (of inclusion and tolerance).” Even the incumbent Raisi government has permitted Afghan refugees and Iranian supporters to hold public protests against the Taliban’s return toNarcotics, and RefugeesCommerce with Afghanistan came to a halt as border crossings were closed for ten days while the security situation was assessed by Iran. The Iranian regime’s decision was made despite a heavy toll—an estimated $5 million in much-needed hard currency flows to Iran from Afghanistan each day. Only gradually has Tehran permitted resumption of intercountry trucking and fuel shipments despite Afghan buyers being the fifth largest consumers of Iranian exports—and after the Taliban cut tariffs by up to 70 percent.While Iran benefits from goods sent eastward, opium and heroin smuggled from Afghanistan is devastating its society. The Taliban, despite claims to have banned production and sale of narcotics, benefits substantially from that illicit trade as documented by the UNSC. Now in control of their entire country, the Taliban could use drugs as a weapon to undermine Iranian society, Tehran’s leaders fear. Iran’s Permanent Representative to United Nations, Majid Takht Ravanchi, emphasized his country is “gravely concerned about … organized criminals active in trafficking in drugs (from Afghanistan).”People seeking asylum and shelter in Iran from the Taliban are another problem. An estimated 3.4 million Afghans sought refuge inside Iran over the past four decades. The economic cost of Afghan refugees is several billion US dollars per year which the Iranian regime under international sanctions struggles to bear. As the Taliban reimposes their rigid interpretation of Sunni Islam, the government in Tehran faces further waves of incoming Afghan refugees. Not surprisingly, its UN Representative Ravanchi declared: “After the recent crisis, many more refugees have entered Iranian territory. We expect the international community to shoulder its responsibility and do a lot more in providing assistance to these refugees.”Intra-Faith Tensions and TerrorismShiites comprise approximately 10 to 15 percent of Afghanistan’s population. Many Afghan refugees entering Iran follow either the Ithna-Ashari, i.e., twelve imam, form of Shiism prevalent in Iran or the Ismaili, i.e., seven imam, variant. They fear sectarian cleansing will recommence under Taliban rule as took place prior to the US arrival in 2001. Iran sees itself as the protector of Shiites worldwide. Consequently, Iran’s Speaker of Parliament Mohammad Ghalibaf demanded the Taliban establish a government which ensures “religious and human rights of the people of Afghanistan from all ethnicities, races and religions,” adding a not so veiled threat that “ultimately the determination of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be the determination of the Afghan people.”As Shiites and other Afghans resisted the Taliban’s final push for control, IRGC Quds Force Commander Esmail Qaani emphasized: “The Shiites of Afghanistan have high importance for the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Subsequently, Iran’s foreign ministry’s spokesman “strongly condemned” the Taliban attack on Panjshir valley, characterizing deaths of resistors there as “martyrdom.” The city council of Tehran promptly renamed an alley in the northern part of the capital city “to show sympathy with the people (there) who are fighting against the Taliban forces.”For the past two decades, the Islamic Republic’s leaders have witnessed Sunni militants gaining footholds within Iran’s border regions, especially Khorasan and Sistan-Baluchistan provinces. Taliban, Al-Qaida, and Islamic State affiliates among other Sunni militants have stepped up the frequency and brutality of attacks on Shiite military and civilian targets in southeastern Iran from safe havens in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The ayatollahs, pinning “insecurity in the world” on “the radical teachings of Wahhabism,” have deployed more forces to the eastern border. They also have promoted Sunnis to high ranks within the Iranian armed forces and been restructuring administration of madrasas or seminaries to stave off radicalization as occurred in Afghanistan and Pakistan.Despite its internal actions to thwart Sunni militancy, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian acknowledged that “Iran is seriously concerned over the spread of terrorism” from Taliban-led Afghanistan. Iran’s UN Representative Ravanchi went even further when addressing the UNSC: “Afghanistan’s territory must not be used, under any circumstances, to threaten or attack any country or to shelter or train terrorists, or to plan or to finance terroristthe BorderIn the weeks leading up to the Taliban’s victory, Iran’s military deployed additional forces close to Afghanistan while commanders reassured the Iranian public on a regular basis that “the police, the army, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are monitoring the border and have the necessary control; so there is no need to be concerned in this regard.” Generals increased review of security in the nation’s east to prevent “any unauthorized entry.”Responding to the Taliban’s gaining access to US weapons systems, the Commander and the Deputy Commander of the Iranian Airforce even went on record that “no aircraft can enter the country’s airspace under any circumstances without our control and permission” and “the units of this force, by exercising intelligence, vigilance, and a watchful eye, will not allow any aggression by outsiders.” A Rear Admiral, speaking at a port city in Iranian Baluchistan, warned its eastern neighbor’s new regime that Tehran “will never allow any countries to disrupt (Iran’s) security and peace.” Yet, hardliners in the Islamic Republic have begun questioning whether their more moderate counterparts are willing to fight the Taliban.Iran has at times in the past, and despite the dangers of so doing, provided logistical support and safe haven to some Taliban leaders. The IRGC, in particular, armed anti-American fighters in Afghanistan. But now with the Taliban controlling Afghanistan’s side of the 570-mile border, Tehran’s position has shifted to dealing with the threat. Rumors of renewed skirmishes between Iranian and Taliban forces have abounded, though often denied by both governments. However, on 3 September, President Raisi acknowledged “conspiracies of enemies” from the east aimed at the Iranian province of Sistan and Baluchistan. Essentially, hitherto sporadic incursions across the border to target Iranian military and municipal facilities have begun to escalate as the Taliban swept across Afghanistan.Shaping Afghanistan’s PoliticsThe Iranian public “holds a gloomy view of the militant group (i.e., the Taliban)” so cheered as Hazara Shiites in the Panjshir Valley rallied with anti-Taliban Sunnis there. Over the past two decades, the IRGC has recruited Shiite Afghan men for militias, such as the Fatemiyoun and Zeinabiyoun brigades, deployed with considerable success against American forces in Iraq and Syria. Those paramilitary units now may be turned eastward, not just to prevent Sunni militant incursions but to fight alongside Afghan Shiite groups resisting the Taliban state. Preparing the public for such a possibility, Iranian leaders and press dispense daily warning of Sunni terrorists “equipped with new and advanced weapons” attacking Shiites in neighboring nations.Hoping both to influence Afghan politics and to avert confrontations, Tehran began brokering intra-Afghan talks between incoming Taliban and outgoing Kabul officials, mediated first by outgoing foreign minister Javad Zarif and subsequently by the new foreign minister Amir-Abdollahian. Subsequently Tehran voiced its support for the formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan.When the US and its allies finally left Kabul on 30 August, Iran’s foreign ministry stressed that Tehran “won’t rush to recognize the Taliban.” For now, Iran is holding firm to its demand that the Taliban must “create an inclusive government … not a minority government against the majority or a government with only one group, but a government that reflects the (country’s) demographic and ethnic composition.”Blaming the US, Co-opting Afghanistan, May Not SucceedPart of Tehran’s outreach to the nascent Taliban government has been to blame the chaos in Afghanistan on two decades of American presence. “America’s military defeat and its withdrawal must become an opportunity to restore life, security and durable peace in Afghanistan,” Iran’s state TV quoted President Raisi, adding “Iran backs efforts to restore stability in Afghanistan … as a neighboring and brother nation.” Ali Akbar Velayati, an advisor to Supreme Leader Khamenei, went even further, explicitly stating Tehran’s foreign policy expectation: “Afghanistan is a part of the Axis of Resistance … with Iran in the center, a collection of countries has been seeking resistance, independence andrevolutionary leaders periodically even publicly cheer the Taliban victory—mainly because the US withdrawal permits Iran freer rein across the region. Yet the potential of Afghanistan becoming the global hub center of terrorist training robs Iran of true satisfaction. “The end of US presence in Afghanistan has ushered in a new era of occupation by the Taliban terrorists,” Iranian policymakers and analysts fear. Tehran’s leaders will likely have to reallocate resources from regional adventurism to domestic stability to counter the Taliban and the other Sunni who are viewed as spreading “criminal and terrorist activities … (and are) tyrannical and ignorant.” The danger from re-Talibanized Afghanistan may also compel greater reliance on Russia and China, a situation which would undermine the independence so dear to many Iranians.Ultimately, Iran has no illusions that “the Taliban had a short-lived experience in governing Afghanistan in the 1990s. And after its downfall, it turned into a militant group mounting guerilla attacks on US and Afghan forces. But militancy is different from governance. Whether they would succeed in ruling Afghanistan with all its ethnoreligious complexities remains an open question.” So, on September 6, the Iranian parliament held a session at which Quds Force Commander Qaani pledged that strife in Afghanistan would not be allowed to spread across the border. Past events have demonstrated to Iranians that the Taliban regime is “no friend of Iran.” "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/12/different-type-of-refugee-onward-journeys-of-gulf-born-migrants-from-politically-volatile-countries/,Different Type of Refugee: Onward Journeys of Gulf-Born Migrants from Politically Volatile Countries,Idil Akinci-Perez,Sep 12 2021,"kThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is home to a sizeable Syrian community, a majority of whom have arrived there as temporary migrant workers following the oil boom in the 1970s. Many of them stayed on with their families, leading to second and third generation UAE-born Syrians living in the UAE under temporary renewable visas, due to the strict migration regimes that prevent permanent settlement and naturalisation of most migrants in the UAE. While this community’s multigenerational existence in the UAE may suggest that they are temporary on paper only, the war in Syria has had significant effects on their sense of long-term security in the UAE, as well as their global mobility as Syrian passport holders. As a result, most of them have strong incentives to try and circumvent both the restrictions tied to their citizenship by birth, and their temporary status in the UAE, by pursuing ‘stronger’ passports from elsewhere.My research with UAE-born Syrians between 2016 and 2020 explored their considerations and experiences of onward migration from the UAE. My respondents considered on-migration to secure a less ambiguous future for themselves than is available in the UAE, which they see as ‘home’, but which has not been formalised as such. My research reveals that in the context of limited options for mobility and security, alternative pathways for long term security emerge, including through asylum-seeking in a third country. Drawing on debates on strategic citizenship and complex migration journeys, this paper illustrates how the experiences of UAE-born Syrians, in the context of the ongoing political turmoil in Syria, straddle the much critiqued yet on-going dichotomies in migration studies, such as between temporary and permanent, forced and voluntary forms of migration. This contribution argues that in a context where the option to citizenship acquisition in host country is foreclosed to migrants, and migrants have very limited (or no) options for residential security elsewhere, their onward journeys for citizenship acquisition can be considered strategic, but not out of volition.Syrians in the UAEIn the UAE, non-nationals, including those born and raised there, are typically unable to obtain local citizenship or permanent residency despite constituting 90 percent of the population. Although the UAE has introduced longer term visas and even pathways to Emirati citizenship in recent years, these reforms only target highly skilled migrants, entrepreneurs, and investors (Fattah and Abu Omar 2021). Thus, the majority of migrants in the UAE are regulated through renewable, sponsored, temporary visas, known as kafala.Syrians historically constitute one of the largest groups of Arab migrants working in the Gulf States (Babar, 2017:7). Their migration trajectories to the UAE vary historically and occupationally. Some of them have arrived as early as the 1950s and 1960s to work in skilled jobs such as judges, teachers, engineers, bankers, doctors or as entrepreneurs and businessmen. In the 1970s, they were also increasingly visible in lesser-skilled and lower paying jobs, working in administrative and technical posts in the army, ports, municipality and local banks (Babar,an estimated 242,000 Syrians live in the UAE, and the UAE government has stated that 100,000 of them have entered the UAE since the start of the conflict in 2011 (De Bel-Air, 2015: 10). Whilst political instability at home makes the Gulf States an attractive place to settle and remain for most Arab migrants, including Syrians, they are not signatories to the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention and have no official framework for managing or accepting refugees or asylum seekers (Babar, 2017:9). Therefore, Syrians in the UAE, including those who have arrived since 2011, are governed through the kafala system, and are not offered formal provisions for more secure residency, or protection from deportation (see The National, 2018, for ad hoc resolutions for Syrians in the UAE).Although Syrians may find strategic solutions to combat their temporary situation in the UAE, their ability to do so is ultimately determined by class, social networks, as well as their nationality (Ruhs, 2013; Vora, 2013; Valenta, 2020). Geopolitical concerns are central to migration policy making in the Gulf and they have historically shaped patterns of migration (see Babar, 2014; Kinninmonth, 2015; Jamal, 2015). Yet, we need to better understand how these concerns, such as war in origin countries, shape Gulf migrants’ desire and ability to move onwards, and the complex pathways they develop to access the long-term security of an alternative passport. We also need to pay particular attention to how Gulf-born migrants experience the ripple effects of the political situation in their countries of citizenship (see Jamal, 2017; Soudy, 2017; Taylor et al. 2017). The fact that being ‘permanently temporary’ is intergenerational in the Gulf States, meaning that children of temporary workers inherit their parents’ citizenship and immigration status by birth, is a unique case to introduce to the study of citizenship and migration.UAE-born Syrians are a good example. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, Syrians have been subjected to tougher border controls, residency visa renewals and security checks in the Gulf and globally (Babar, 2014; Kinninmonth, 2015). As residency in the UAE is predominantly linked to work permits, not being able to renew residencies has serious implications, ranging from not being able to enrol children in schools, to not being able to work and earn a living wage (De Bel-Air, 2015:11). Moreover, in order to renew temporary visas in the UAE, migrants need to have a valid passport. However, political instability in Syria impacts the Syrian authorities’ ability or desire to renew passports for their nationals living abroad, including in the UAE (Surak, 2021:177). Military service is compulsory for Syrian nationals, including those residing abroad. Failing to attend or pay the exemption fee, Syrian authorities refuse to renew passports, which has direct consequences for renewing their residencies in the UAE (Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, 2014). Moreover, at 800$, Syrian passports are also the most expensive to issue and renew globally (Alarabiya, 2017).If Syrians in the UAE lose their temporary work or residency visas, their options of moving to a third country are extremely restricted, considering that Syrian passports have lost most of their value in terms of stability and mobility due to the war, and selective border controls apply most strictly to this group (see Passport Index 2021). Moreover, due to the volatile political situation in Syria, ‘return’ is not a viable option. In fact, UAE-born Syrians can become refugees if they lose their temporary residency (see Babar, Ewers and Khattab 2018, 1554). In this context, a wealthy minority of Syrians in the UAE purchases passports through ‘Citizenship by Investment’ programmes (Maceda, 2018). For middle class Syrians, like other Gulf migrants, migrating to a Western country for higher education or work, in the hope of eventually naturalising, is also a common strategy (Ali, 2011). However, study and work visas are increasingly hard to obtain, and were never an option for the majority of Syrians in the UAE and elsewhere (Khaishgi, 2017). For Syrians with limited resources or options, asylum seeking in European Union countries also emerged as a last resort, as this study shows. Importantly, this is a result of having no acceptable alternatives to their unstable legal status in the Gulf. This brings me to briefly review the existing conceptual debates on strategic citizenship and complex onward migrationof war at ‘home’ on temporary migrantsIn the context of a global inequality, where individuals’ mobility as well as residential security is determined by the passports they hold, pursuing citizenship from privileged countries is understood as compensational, strategic and pragmatic (Mavroudi, 2006; Harpaz and Mateos, 2018). Restrictive migration regimes and geopolitical concerns are prevalent globally and they are integral to the reproduction of global inequalities premised in citizenship, providing a central context to understand why an alternative passport is appealing to certain populations. For instance, residential insecurity, arising from restrictive citizenship and immigration policies, is directly linked to questions of citizenship and why it matters for those who are excluded from it in host countries (Cook-Martin, 2019; Bloemraad and Sheares, 2017). Furthermore, geopolitical concerns, such as war, or general political instability, condition the demand for another passport, as it provides means for basic protection and a definite place to live in a global context of hostile border regimes. Thus, a liminal legal status among migrants who could otherwise be classified as refugees, such as the Syrians discussed in this paper, creates added obstacles (see Menjivar, 2006; Babar, Ewers and Khattab 2018).In order to have a fuller picture of when, how, for whom and in what contexts citizenship matters – important questions that require further attention and investigation in citizenship studies (Bloemraad and Sheares, 2017) –, it is necessary to combine the literature on strategic citizenship with that on complex migration journeys. While strategic citizenship acknowledges international migration as a key strategy to circumvent inequalities premised on citizenship (Surak, 2021, 171), it remains largely disengaged from important conceptual discussions in migration studies, such as on volition, agency, and migrant decision-making. As a result, the experiences of people who try to access the security offered by stronger passports is often studied through a binary lens of forced migrants, e.g. asylum seekers and refugees (Kibreab, 2003; Miller, 2001; Gibney, 2014), versus strategic naturalisers, such as wealthy and middle-class individuals from non-Western countries who pursue better passports as a form of insurance policy (see Surak, 2021; Harpaz and Mateos, 2018).In temporary migration regimes like in the UAE, migrants are at perpetual risk of losing residency rights regardless of their citizenship. But should their home countries experience sudden shifts in political circumstances, this risk grows exponentially, leading to a perceived necessity for citizenship acquisition from elsewhere. This process can be understood as circumstantial migration (see Carling and Haugen 2020), as changing circumstances result in unpredicted, complex onward migration journeys, for example asylum-seeking, which migrants would not have considered before. Complexities of their onward migration, however, cannot be captured through prevailing categories, such as between temporary/permanent and forced/voluntary forms of migration. By assuming that people move in linear fashion, these descriptive categories tend to ignore that experiences as well as motivations of individuals can change over space and time, corresponding to a number of socio-economic and political circumstances in the contexts they inhabit (Crawley & Skleparis, 2018: 55; see Fiddian-Qasmiyeh, 2011 for ‘overlapping’ and ‘multiple’ refugeehoods).At a conceptual level, circumstances connect with the analytical discussion on volition, alternatives and options, which Erdal and Oeppen bring forward (2018). Circumstances are key in understanding volition in migration decisions, because they (re)shape the basic needs of migrants in their particular context, as well as a range of alternatives available to them if they decide not to migrate (Erdal and Oeppen, 2018:985; Crawley and Skleparis, 2018; Gibney, 2011:48).These alternatives can change along a migration journey, as Erdal and Oeppen discuss. Yet, in the case of Syrians in the UAE, their options, for example for long-term security and mobility, change whilst they reside in their host country as temporary residents, because of what is happening in Syria, the country they hold passports from. It is in the context of these changing circumstances that they consider, or experience, onward migration journeys, fundamentally questioning dichotomous migration categories, and illustrating a new example of a complex migration trajectory (see Snel, Bilgili and Staringthe dichotomy between forced versus voluntary migration fails to account for the temporal and circumstantial aspects of Gulf migrants’ onward journeys to Western countries. The experiences of Syrians holding temporary residencies in the UAE may not be considered as volatile to the same extent as those fleeing war in Syria. However, a sudden shift in political circumstances, such as war in Syria, may intensify their sense of temporariness in the UAE, and instigate a necessity for citizenship acquisition from elsewhere. Yet, the alternatives for citizenship acquisition for these groups are doubly restricted, as they have no access to permanency in their host countries, and their ability to move onward is constrained by strict border regimes targeting citizens of politically volatile countries (Shaheen, 2017). Since their decision for onward migration is to a large degree motivated by accessing long-term residential security that is not offered in the UAE, their experiences are better understood as ‘being forced to leave’, even if they migrate onwards under so called voluntary categories, such as for education or work.Second, thinking of migrants in the UAE and the Gulf in terms of either permanent or temporary limits our understanding of the meaning of these places for them and their decision for onward migration. Even though a body of literature illustrates the difficulties of framing migrant experiences and categories as either temporary or permanent (see Bailey, 2002, Rajkumar et.al, 2012), there is an ongoing, Eurocentric notion that perceives all temporary residencies of migrants as transit places, or in other words ‘meaningless temporary refuges before migrants reach their final destination’ (Snel, Bilgili and Staring 2020, 4). This might be the case for stepwise migrants in the Gulf, who have pre-determined objectives of onward migration to Western countries, and who take specific actions to achieve that (Valenta, 2020). However, this perception ignores the unique situation of Gulf-born migrants, who despite being labelled as temporary, are de facto from the Gulf, and perceive these places as their primary home. In fact, for most of them, migrating to a third country is seen as a temporary step to acquire citizenship and eventually return to the Gulf with a ‘stronger passport’ (see Akinci, 2019; Jamal, 2017; Ali, 2011; Surak, 2021, 177). This shows that restricting paths to citizenship in the Gulf has important effects on the way migrants perceive the value and meaning of citizenship in general.Conclusion and OutlookThrough the experiences of UAE born Syrians, I illustrated how in restrictive migration contexts such as in the UAE, a sudden shift in political circumstances in origin countries, such as the on-going war in Syria, directly affects the options and alternatives migrants have for long term security and stability.It is in this context that UAE-born Syrians find citizenship acquisition elsewhere increasingly appealing, yet their ability to move onwards is constrained by strict border regimes, even for those with adequate financial assets. This paper argues that when migrants have no way of obtaining citizenship in a host country, and have limited (or no) options for residential security elsewhere, their onward journeys to acquire passports can be framed as strategic, but not voluntary. This is particularly the case for migrants who were born and raised in host states, but who inherited a lack of basic rights to residency and protection from deportation as second- or third-generation migrants. Consequently, asylum seeking in a third country emerges as an option for those who have limited resources, as this paper shows. Even if these populations have adequate resources to move onwards under ‘voluntary categories’, such as for work, higher education, or family unification, their motivations to undertake a journey to access long-term residential security place them in migration categories that could be rendered as “being forced to leave”. Moreover, their onward journeys are often described by migrants as a temporary step that allows them to acquire a (Western) passport to return ‘home’ – to the UAE – ‘permanently’. In so doing, this contribution provides an example of complex migration journeys, and contributes to analytical discussions on voluntariness, choice and alternatives when onward migration is considered in pursuit of an alternative citizenship.The focus of future academic inquiry should not be on whether to categorise migrants such as those who were the subject of this text as temporary or permanent, voluntary or forced, but to understand what pushes them to seek alternative permanencies elsewhere, and under what conditions. This also requires us to bring debates on strategic citizenship and complex migration journeys closer together, as changing circumstances can directly shape why and how citizenship matters, and what options and pathways are there to access it. Considering the prevalence of both restrictive immigration policies globally and geopolitical concerns that inform border policy making, similar complex journeys can be foreseen among other migrant groups in the UAE, and wider Gulf, as well as in other temporary migration contexts. Most recently, as we witness the Taliban take over Afghanistan, and subsequent stories of former President Ashraf Ghani and Afghan civilians taking ‘refuge’ or temporary protection in the UAE, we should turn our attention to Afghans who settled in the UAE for decades and across generations, and understand how the sudden political shift in Afghanistan impacts their future security and mobility, either in the UAE orAkinci, Idil. 2019. “Culture In The ‘Politics Of Identity’: Conceptions Of National Identity And Citizenship Among Second-Generation Non-Gulf Arab Migrants In Dubai”. Journal Of Ethnic And Migration Studies 46 (11): 2309-2325. doi:10.1080/1369183x.2019.1583095.Ali, Syed. 2011. “Going And Coming And Going Again: Second-Generation Migrants In Dubai”. Mobilities 6 (4): 553-568. doi:10.1080/17450101.2011.603947.Babar, Zahra. 2017.Arab Migrant Communities in the GCC.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/12/reflections-on-afghanistan-war-is-folly-for-the-weak-on-wisdom-and-will/,Reflections on Afghanistan: War is Folly for the Weak on Wisdom and Will,Robert Cassidy,Sep 12 2021,"Reflections on Afghanistan: War is Folly for the Weak on Wisdom and WillThe results of the South Asia war games over the last several decades became apparent last month.Pakistan and its Taliban creation won.China and Russia tied for second place.Iran came in third.America quit.The Afghans suffered most, and lost. Embarking on wars without knowing who your genuine enemies are and without understanding what the sine qua non for the defeat of those enemies might be, is reckless, malfeasant, and negligent in massive ways.It is the height of folly.If senior leaders make decisions to go to war without discussion and without arguments; if they emphasize action and revenge absent analysis and rationality; if they attend to the tactics and violence without thinking through an end to a war that links it to a durable peace, they most likely suffer from hubris, self-delusion, and ignorance.Folly is their fate.Their soldiers, citizens, and allies are destined to trauma, defeat, and tragedy.The first two quotes below convey realities about policy, strategy, and war that endure over centuries. The theorists who penned them were so extraordinary that their work remains salient still.The third quote holds up over time too. It points to the folly of war when senior civilian and military leaders lack the intellectual capital, analytical capacity, and humility to think through the most important factors pertaining to war and strategy.The first principle is that the ultimate substance of enemy strength must be traced back to the fewest possible sources, and ideally to one alone – Clausewitz, On War, p. 617.A victorious army wins victories before seeking battles; an army destined to defeat fights in the hope of winning – Sun Tzu, The Art of War, p. 87.Woodenheadedness, the source of self-deception, is a factor that plays a remarkably large role in government.It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be deflected by the facts – Barbara Tuchman, The March of Folly, p. 7.In view of the shameful and avoidable tragedy that unfolded rapidly in Afghanistan last month, it is important to be clear and candid about who was accountable for this epic failure in U.S. strategy.To be certain, Team America is horrible at strategy in wars for limited aims.All four presidents and their senior national security leaders own this debacle to varying degrees of magnitude and ineptitude. The war in Afghanistan was the only just war of the last 20 years, in terms of the justification for going to war and in the way the coalition mainly endeavored to fight it.It was in theory, the just and righteous war in response to the 9/11 attacks.It could have been, and would have been the good war of the post-9/11 wars, if the U.S., the coalition partners, and the international community had mustered the will and the strategic wisdom to fulfil a post-war moral commitment to Afghanistan.There is a debt, too, that dates back to the U.S. role in the Soviet war.A dearth of strategy and will mainly explain the defeat.War is folly, certainly, for those who are weak on wisdom and short on will.It is now clear that America cannot be trusted as an ally.It has been clear for the last 20 years that Pakistan is neither an ally or friend, but a ruthless and wily enemy of the U.S. and Afghanistan.Just weeks before the 20-year anniversary of 9/11, the richest country on the planet with a population of over 331 million abandoned one of the poorest countries on the planet, an ally, with a population of about 35 million, to the most perfidious country on the planet, Pakistan, an ally in name only, with a population of almost 200 million.“Never forget” metamorphosed, after years of no strategy, arrogance, ignorance, wrong wars, loads of valor, much sacrifice, massive expenditures, intractable stalemate, and Pakistan’s perfidy, into this:forget, abandon, and move on.value of the political object, the morality of the war, and the perception of victory or defeat comprise the central logic of war.The political object, and its value, should guide and permeate war.An understanding of the value of the object and a grasp of the enemy’s value of the object are the most important factors in crafting a viable strategy. The value of the political object – dismantling, defeating, and denying al-Qaeda sanctuary – of the Afghan War derived from the horrific losses suffered from al Qaeda’s 9/11 raids.A stable Afghanistan, inhospitable to al Qaeda and other foreign terrorist organizations, the Haqqani network for example, would have supported that object.But, ending Pakistan’s sanctuary, cultivation, support, and export of Islamist militants was essential to achieve that object.We failed here catastrophically.Stability, security, and the inhospitableness of both Pakistan and Afghanistan to Islamist terrorists were an imperative because the Pashtun belt overlaps both countries across an unrecognized border that cannot be secured.Pakistan’s calculations and machinations in support of some of the most virulently Islamist terrorists were not a secret.Pakistan’s Inter Service Intelligence Directorate (ISI) is the world’s number one exporter of Islamist terrorists and nuclear weapons technology.The naivete, illusion, and delusion manifested by senior policymakers and diplomats, especially vis-à-vis Pakistan, account for this failure.The political object was to ensure that Afghanistan would never become a sanctuary for another 9/11-like attack again. However, the perceived value of the object diminished markedly because 20 years of stalemate saw the costs of this war, in magnitude and duration, exceed the value of persevering with a modest number of advisors and funds, to most of the U.S public and to the president.The single worst attack against the U.S. homeland is now 20 years in the past. The Islamist terrorists who perpetrated that egregious assault, planned, recruited, and directed it from Afghanistan with the benefit of sanctuary that Pakistan and its Taliban progeny provided.When the Taliban controlled most of Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001, that was then the highwater mark of Pakistan’s foreign and security policy vis-à-vis Afghanistan.Pakistan’s Inter Service Intelligence Directorate’s number one export is terrorism and the only flavor is Islamist.The Saudis’ decades long funding, export and proselytization of its own Wahhabi-Salafi creed to Pakistan and Afghanistan, to be sure, also played a role in radicalizing Pakistan and its Taliban creation.But, the avoidable, tragic, and shameful abandonment of Afghanistan to Pakistan and its Taliban proxies last month marked a new high-water mark for Pakistan’s security elites.Pakistan, a major non-NATO ally of America and a beneficiary of tens of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars, brought about our biggest defeat since the Vietnam War.It pulled this off through perfidy and protraction.Pakistan had no small assistance from U.S. strategic malfeasance and ineptitude.Ultimately, a host of civilian and military leaders at the strategic and operation levels are responsible for the American defeat in Afghanistan.The Pollyanna problem among American generals certainly contributed in a major way.The U.S. proclivity for tactics over strategy also had a big part.To be sure, the soldiers and Marines who did most of the fighting and dying for America performed with valor and skill in the main.This article’s main purpose is to elucidate what the four presidential administrations who oversaw the war in Afghanistan were responsible and accountable for in terms of policy and strategy miscalculations and missteps.Since this is an article, and not a book, it will necessarily focus on the most important factors in strategy and war:the political object and the will that derives from the value of that object; the critical thinking and the wisdom about strategy of the senior policymakers in those administrations.war is not an act of senseless passion but is controlled by its political object, the value of this object must determine the sacrifices to be made for it in magnitude and also in duration. Once the expenditure of effort exceeds the value of the political object, the object must be renounced and peace must follow– Clausewitz, On War, p. 92.George W. Bush: Strong of Will and Weak on WisdomWhether George W. Bush was the worst president in American history will long be debated, but his decision to invade Iraq is easily the worst foreign policy decision ever made by an American president – Jean Edward Smith, Bush, p. 603.Will derives from and relates to the political object and its value.In the months and years immediately following the 9/11 attacks, the value of the object was high and there was strong support in the U.S. and among America’s friends and allies to wage war against al Qaeda and its supporters.But, since fear, guilt, hubris, and ignorance permeated Bush’s inner circle of decisionmakers and ideologues, it never crafted a strategy for Afghanistan.Very few in that administration knew anything about Afghanistan.Bush and his senior leaders acted before they analyzed; they overreached before they understood.Bush’s team was fraught with illusions and paradoxes. The main illusion was that President George W. Bush brought into office with him a talented national security team. The reality was that he chose one of the most inept and dysfunctional national se­curity teams in history.A fatal contradiction that derived from the Bush League’s risible nescience was that it opted to expand the war against al Qaeda and its supporters into a wide-reaching global war of regime change while at the same time eschewing post-combat stability and state building efforts in Afghanistan, the origin of 9/11.It strained credulity then and it accounts for a large part of the catastrophic abandonment and defeat in Afghanistan now.The willful malfeasance that George W. Bush and his closest advisors committed (torture, intensified renditions, black sites, Bagram, Guantanamo, the colossally stupid Iraq invasion, Abu Ghraib) and the wisdom they omitted (reason, thinking, strategy, moral rectitude, and state recovery for Afghanistan to address the root causes) brought about massive reverses for U.S. national security interests generally and for stability in Afghanistan specifically.The Bush administration found the very idea of rebuilding Afghanistan (nation-building was a reviled term in the Rumsfeld Pentagon) abhorrent and instead targeted individual senior al-Qaeda leaders and terrorists for killing and capturing. For at least the first six years in Afghanistan, the U.S. depended too heavily on warlords, accommodated unscrupulous Afghan leaders, used air power indiscriminately, and killed too many non-combatants.Predatory warlords, venal police, massive corruption from the influx of money, nights raids, and civilian casualties combined, to aggrieve Afghans. All of this unjustly wronged many Afghans and catalyzed support among a number of Pashtun Afghans for the revival of the Taliban.To make things much, much, worse, Team Bush committed gross strategic malfeasance by choosing to invade Iraq out of ignorance and arrogance, only to create a quagmire. Though completely unrelated to the 9/11 attacks from Afghanistan, the debacle in Iraq came to fuel support for the Taliban’s regeneration in Afghanistan; it also animated thousands of jihadists around the world.A dozen or so senior principals and deputies in that regime expended much more time and energy fabricating and propagating the arguments to start an unnecessary and unjust war in Iraq, than they devoted to the war in Afghanistan.Pakistan and its Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) were calculating and machinating as a consequence.They decided to increase and accelerate their regeneration of the Taliban insurgency partly as a consequence of America’s diversion towas relegated to a secondary and poorly resourced effort for the U.S., with a very limited number of special operations and conventional forces conducting strikes and raids to kill or capture key leaders. There were too few troops and too little resources committed to address the challenges of stabilizing the country. During the middle of the last decade when the U.S. was mired in Iraq, security gaps developed in the east and south of Afghanistan.Pakistan filled those gaps with two of its preferred exports, and Islamist surrogates, the Taliban and the Haqqani network.The U.S. leadership was then also unwilling or unable to either understand, or coerce or compel, the real enemies who had directly or indirectly aided and abetted the Taliban regime and its al-Qaeda brethren in Afghanistan. Physical sanctuary, material, recruits, funds, and ideology flowed from Pakistan while funds and ideology from Saudi Arabia and other sponsors helped mobilize insurgents and terrorists in South Asia for decades. Pakistan continued to provide all of the above means of support to the Taliban and other militants after the Taliban fled to Pakistan in late 2001 and early 2002.It was Bush, the commander in chief, who saw no need for rigorous debate among his war council.Not on the advisability and necessity of invading Iraq.Not on the composition of the invasion force.Not on what should follow the invasion – Robert Draper, To Start a War, p. 401.Barack Obama: Stronger on Wisdom and Weaker on WillPresident Barak Obama had campaigned to get out of the Iraq war and to double down on efforts to turn around the faltering war in Afghanistan.His national security lieutenants exhibited more suppleness of mind and humility in behavior than their predecessors. They revisited the logic and strategic imperatives of the protracted stalemate in Afghanistan.His advisors read books about the Vietnam War.They discussed, argued, and counterargued the merits of counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism. In the end, the will of the Obama administration was modest even though its senior members seemed to bring better capacity for strategic wisdom and critical analysis to the war.This president was willing to make an effort to keep his campaign promise to invest in the war in Afghanistan.However, President Obama’s team did not have the unity, inter-agency harmony, or genuine desire to compel Pakistan to stop providing sanctuary and support to the Taliban.The senior people in that administration who were interlocutors to Pakistan succumbed to the ISI narratives which warned if the U.S. pushed them too hard, the really scary Islamists would take over Pakistan, along with its nuclear weapons.That administration valued the stability of Pakistan and the security of its strategic weapons more than Afghanistan. To its credit, though, the Obama team was also willing to accept great risk in undertaking the raid that killed bin Laden. It simply lacked the will to fully confront and alter Pakistan’s strategic malice.The Obama administration tried to focus resources on Afghanistan with a measured and prudent approach to strategy. It undertook a laudable but insufficient effort to align means to the political object by crafting a theory of strategic victory for Afghanistan with the surge that began in 2009. But Pakistan’s malign yet predictable strategic conduct, coupled with an American inability to muster the creativity, resources and coercive measures to curb Pakistan’s pathological proclivities, accounted for the gap between the theory and the practice.Following years of a limited number of troops conducting tactical strikes and raids, the Obama administration’s theory of strategy and operational surge in Afghanistan made discernible operational gains but these were fleeting because the strategy failed to modify, reduce, or stop the sine qua non for victory in Afghanistan. Almost every U.S. DOD report on progress in Afghanistan since 2008 explicitly stated that Pakistan’s sanctuary and support prevented the defeat of the Taliban.To defeat the Taliban and put an end to the stalemate, America and its real allies needed to think creatively and act forcefully enough to stop Pakistan’s support and sanctuary for the Islamist insurgency and other terrorists that Pakistan’s ISI supported and still supports.Donald Trump: Weak of Will and Weak on WisdomIn one sense, people should be grateful that the 45th president and his team did not do more damage to America’s national security interests.This is partly attributable to a few senior advisors and principals who could constrain the president’s worst proclivities and impulses.This guy came into office wanting to get out of Afghanistanpresident himself had little will or interest in continuing the war in Afghanistan but for the first two years he heeded the counsel of his secretary of defense and national security advisor. From the beginning of that administration’s tenure in 2017, the executive branch hemmed and hawed in major ways a number of times.His team did craft a revised strategy with an ostensible commitment to win in Afghanistan.In announcing this strategy, the president declared, “Our troops will fight to win. We will fight to win. From now on, victory will have a clear definition.Terrorists take heed: America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.”An increase of about 3,500 U.S. forces to a total of over 14,000 to advise and assist the Afghan security forces attended this renewed but fleeting commitment to turn the war around. Beyond the imperative to find a regional solution that would reduce external support for the Taliban, the approach re-aligned the increase in troops to advise more tactical units, to continue to double the Afghan special security forces and to expand the Afghan air force, all toward the aim of overmatching the Taliban in the fighting.The idea was that this increased capacity could build military pressure and operational momentum against the Taliban to convince them to reconcile with the Afghan government.Pressure on Pakistan would curb the effects of sanctuary, in theory.Although the commander in chief exhibited little strategic wisdom and no will to continue the war, his predilections did not predominate until most of the adults were gone in late 2018 after he fired his only capable defense secretary and decent national security advisor.Once they were gone, the 45th president was far less restrained and sound in his action and decisions.He selected and empowered Zal Khalilzad to negotiate an end to the war with a peace agreement that saw a hasty extraction from Afghanistan for the U.S., but the terms of the agreement were plainly incongruous and disingenuous because the negotiations excluded the Afghan government and security forces America had been supporting, while stipulating that all U.S./NATO forces had to withdraw before the Taliban would negotiate with the Afghan government.It strained credulity to argue that no one in the administration knew that this represented an abandonment of Afghanistan.Worse still, during the last two years of the war, the 45th president authorized the theater commander to use air power more liberally during the very periods that human intelligence capacity was diminishing.Civilian casualties spiked again beginning in 2019 and the Taliban’s recruits increased.Joe Biden: Weak of Will and Modest on WisdomThe Biden team clearly seems to have entered office already decided to get out of Afghanistan, and committed to go with the risibly unenforceable peace agreement signed by the previous, and most horrid administration in American history.It was a circus show and the terms that 45 and Khalilzad agreed to signaled the abandonment of Afghanistan.To be sure, many citizens of the United States, including myself, support the advent of team Biden.A sense of decency has supplanted the machinations of an evil miscreant.Americans should be grateful for what this administration is advocating for infrastructure and the plight of ordinary people.Also, to be sure, the decision to end the twenty-year war in Afghanistan was both courageous and laudable.However, the current president’s immodest obduracy and modest strategic wisdom, combined with what seems to be a weak national security team, brought about a withdrawal from Afghanistan that turned into an ignominious retreat, a debacle, and a tragedy for all those who perished at the airport and for those whom America abandoned.The current president decided in 2008-2009, when he was a senator and then became vice president, that Afghanistan was not worth the effort.His relationship with Karzai had soured beyond repair and he strongly argued against the surge during the reassessment among Obama’s principals.Those arguing for the surge in Afghanistan won the debate in 2009.Biden lost.His obduracybe fair, some of Biden’s national security team argued against a complete withdrawal.Surely, they explained that a small footprint of special and conventional forces advisors and support could sustain the Afghan special security forces, air force, and conventional forces, so those Afghan forces would continue to fight and resupply.This was a modest and affordable cost, under $40 billion per year, to backstop a twenty-year investment and effort where many served and sacrificed.Since 2014, the Afghans were in the lead for security and their forces were doing the preponderance of fighting and dying.Many more Afghan civilians and soldiers had died in the war than American or coalition members had.The president had dug in before inauguration.And, few resisted vehemently.No one resigned.A more judicious approach, one that brooked the facts on the ground and the realities in the South Asia region, might have been to hold with, or increase the advisors from 2,500 to 5,000 or 8,500, to sustain the most capable Afghan security forces and renegotiate the end of the war. His team could have then worked an agreement that included the Afghan government it supported and provided terms to allow the U.S., the Coalition, and its Afghan partners to credibly enforce the pledges of the Taliban, the Haqqani network, and their Pakistani benefactors to comply with the terms.Instead, the current team accepted in toto an agreement that was not worth the paper it was written on.Hope is not a viable method to enforce terms with enemies who have only exhibited mendacity and lethal treachery.ConclusionThe history of military conflict in Afghanistan [has] been one of initial success, followed by long years of floundering and ultimate failure. We’re not going to repeat that mistake – George W. Bush, Virginia Military Institute, April 2002. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.If ignorant both of your enemy and of yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril – Sun Tzu, The Art of War, p. 84.No one starts a war — or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so — without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.The former is its purpose; the latter its operational objective – Clausewitz, On War, p. 579.Learning from experience is a faculty almost never practiced – Barbara Tuchman, The March of Folly, p. 383.Afghanistan is not the graveyard of empires.Pakistan’s support of Islamists like the Taliban and the Haqqani clan precluded a successful outcome.America and its penchant for action and tactics over analysis and strategic wisdom, make it the graveyard of strategy.The list of American failures in far-away wars with limited objects is not a short one.The main difficulty with limited-war strategy for America stems from a propensity for focusing on the means instead of thinking through the strategic logic that aligns the means to the political objects. This predilection poses a challenge for America’s strategy in limited wars because the values of the political objects are more modest for this country than those of insurgents and their external enablers.The worth of a win in Afghanistan also varied with the magnitude and duration of the violence.Afghanistan is not Vietnam, either, although the images of the poorly thought through and maladroitly executed U.S. retreat from Afghanistan in August do harken to images of Saigon’s fall at the end of April in 1975.Yet, there were similar insurmountable factors in the strategic logic of both wars.North Vietnam and the Viet Cong saw very high value in their object of an independent and unified Vietnam.They were willing to pay almost any cost to achieve it.They also showed superior strategic savvy.Fighting a war of attrition was smart and it brought victory.Pakistan and its Taliban allies also ascribed a higher value to their object of Taliban rule in an Afghanistan inhospitable to India.The real and exaggerated threats that Pakistan’s security elites perceive about Indian influence in Afghanistan account for their will to protract and escalate the war, and made attrition a winning model. The Taliban and their Pakistani advisors were willing to pay more.In both cases, along with Somalia in the 1990s, a prolonged war of attrition was a war-losing approach for the U.S.Few presidents wanted to explain the why and to what end well enough for most Americans to understand what was at stake.Americans did not want or care about an Afghanistan inhospitable to al Qaeda and other foreign terrorists nearly as much as their enemies in Pakistan wanted a Taliban theocracy hospitable to Islamists and beholden to the ISI.the end, the major factors that explain the West’s failure in Afghanistan were the absence of strategy, the lack of wisdom and will to stop the key enemy (Pakistan) from supporting the Taliban and other Islamist terrorists, and the invasion of Iraq. Harmful consequences at the operational and tactical levels that derived from these major factors were the revival of hated warlords, massive increases in corruption and criminal patronage, venal and predatory local politicians and police, too many instances of civilian casualties because of a dearth of security forces, and the full regeneration of the Taliban as a consequence of all of the above.

Valença and Daniel Edler Duarte,Sep 11 2021,"Seas and oceans are not leading players in International Relations (IR). Maritime spaces have been considered to be physical media where agents interact or project their interests and their abilities to attain their objectives. Despite their importance in the expansion of international society, seas and oceans are characterised as spaces in which international politics take place. Considering the connection between Maritime Studies and IR, why then are maritime spaces treated as marginal and how is their importance to politics to be understood? This marginalisation has come about because of the role assumed by maritime spaces in IR. As they are not endowed with agency, IR do little to explore both the social role of maritime spaces and their impact on politics: maritime spaces are means, not sources or ends, of action. Taking the norm-based Constructivism of Nick Onuf as theoretical lens, we suggest that maritime spaces act as institutions, i.e., as imbued with a set of rules and practices that, repeated over time, have fostered stable patterns of action suited to agents’ intentions, thus stabilising expectations and procedures.We explore these questions in a lengthy fashion in the forthcoming edited volume “Nothing, but the Sea: Global Dialogues on Maritime Domain” (Routledge 2022). In this article, we present a shorter version of our chapter.The marginalisation of maritime spaces in International RelationsThe marginalisation of maritime spaces should come as no surprise. IR is a field where states predominate and feature as leading actors at the international level. The logic of rational actor places agents at the centre of decision making, and the means they use to attain their objectives are merely instrumental and exogenous.The sea has been presented as a medium for projecting power and a platform where international relations are constructed out of interactions among states, non-traditional political communities, and non-state actors. The use of maritime spaces as media for projecting power or world domination is a recurring theme among authors in this field. Take Pax Britannica as an example: the sea was central to British hegemony not just as a waterway, but also for trade and contact among nations – including issues of war and peace. Maritime space reflects the context in which international politics wereour forthcoming chapter we present examples taken from different areas, such as Geopolitics and IR Theories to provide basis for our critique of the marginalisation of maritime spaces. We show that, although central to operationalising their theories, none of the authors and approaches endorse a leading role for maritime space. Maritime spaces figure in their analyses as a function of the realities states have faced in specific historical epochs.A similar critique may be raised regarding the literature on regionalism and security studies. The peculiarities and distinctive nature of maritime spaces neglected to the detriment of tenets adapted from land-based categories, including the application of major concepts (Gonzalez, 2020), leading to significant analytical limitations. The concept of maritime security itself falls within this grey zone. The term “maritime security” is used in the literature to justify the development of strategies to cope with situations of instability and threats in maritime spaces. It serves as an umbrella term applied to national security, maritime environment, economic development, and human security. However, threats are seen in association with land space, suggesting that the discussion of maritime spaces is not afforded autonomy, but derives from epistemological debates considered more relevant to the field.Norm-Based ConstructivismWe critique the role attributed to maritime spaces by IR through the analytical lens of Onuf’s norm-based Constructivism. We present this theoretical reference in the subsequent paragraphs.Norm-based Constructivism treats rules as links that connect society and individuals, influencing their relationships and the manners in which they constitute one another mutually. As the world out there is not predetermined, agents cannot be understood outside their social relationships: it is these social relationships that constitute them as they are. It is thus agents who make the world what it is through social interactions and in what we do and say to one another. While IR positivist approaches correlate the world out there with reality and truth, norm-based Constructivism refutes those ideas. Truth – and consequently the world out there – are not given for us to observe. They are conditional on a system of meanings in which actors are both embedded and which they construct by way of speech acts.The most important way of constructing the world is through what we say: saying is doing and, accordingly, agents make society and society makes agents. Political actors construct, access, and understand the world out there based on how speech acts are used. This not only reflects how we act, but functions equally as a basis for action properly speaking. As such, rules are fundamental parts of social life. They tell us who the active participants in society – the agents – are and determine who can be considered an agent in society, based on declarations that express what people should do. The “what” is the pattern of behaviour to be adopted, while the “should” is the behaviour’s fit with that pattern.Agents have the ability to make choices and can deal with rules in differing ways – on their own behalf or on behalf of social constructions – which includes following them or suiting them to the socially-constructed world. Rules are expected to be followed, and non-compliance has consequences expressed by other rules. By way of choices made by agents, the material world becomes a social reality. From their choices, their responses to rules, and the patterns resulting from those responses, agents’ interests can even be perceived. Agents do not need to display self-awareness of their interests to act based on them, because people do not need to think of themselves as agents to be agents. Nonetheless, although enabled by rules, the capacity of agency is alwaysof either material or social constraints, agents are not free to act at will. Agents’ freedom depends on their ability to acknowledge the material and social constraints on them.When rules afford an agent the opportunity to act, they impose limits on the other agents’ autonomy, so that on the social plane there is no full autonomy. Rules transform aspects of the material world into resources available for agents to use, in addition to making resources of agents and institutions. Agents exercise their freedom by choosing to act in one way or another in situations where choice is unavoidable.In that context, it must be considered how the content of rules (i.e., to whom they refer and in what situations, as well as what responses are expected) is expressed. This is done by way of speech acts, which will have results if whoever is listening to responds to what is being said. Assertive speech acts are rules that inform agents how things stand and the likely consequences of disregarding that information. Directive speech acts are imperative in nature and contain information as to the consequences of disregarding the rules. Commissive speech acts, meanwhile, which involve promises in the event the rules are complied with, characterise rights and duties.Although speech acts are central to social life, they themselves say nothing of any future situation, i.e., whether the speech act and the response to it will repeat in time. However, if the speech act is repeated to the same general effect, those involved will believe that the repetition is important, leading to a convention. Conventions operate in a manner analogous to rules: while the latter state what agents should do, conventions remind agents of what they have done. Agents come to believe in the social construction that it is the words themselves – rather than the speaker – that are responsible for whatever happens.Similar to conventions, institutions remind agents of what they have done and, by virtue of their stability, make it explicit that not only do agents act within a certain constitutional framework, but they also act on that framework, collectively changing both institutional traits and themselves in the process. Institutions are sets of rules and practices that, by repetition over time, produce stable patterns of action suited to agents’ intentions. They respond to these impacts within an institutional context, institutionalising the structure under rules for dealing with such situations, which are the social arrangements.All three types of speech act are present in institutions, but depending on the predominant type, there will be a specific type of corresponding social arrangement. When assertive acts predominate, agents are arranged in networks of rules and practices. When directive rules are most in evidence, there are chain-of-command or organisational arrangements, where each agent is designated to occupy a social position. Lastly, commissive speech acts, involving commitment, tend to be associated with agents in partnerships or associations with other agents, where roles are distributed to agents under rules of commitment.The patterns of agents’ choices have overall consequences, whether intended or not: they affect the distribution of material and social benefits among the agents, thus impacting control over resources and over other agents and their activities. Consequently, some agents benefit more than others from the institution and, with time, institutions promote advantages for some at the cost of others. Accordingly, agents who benefit more from the rules are more inclined to obey them, while those who benefit less may obey or break them, resulting in a loss of benefits for other agents.Agents respond to rules with the resources available to them, and asymmetry in access to those resources through institutions means that some agents exert greater control than others over the content of the rules and over success in their being followed. The result is that rules (and institutions) lead to rule, a condition in which some agents use the rules to exert control and obtain advantages over other agents. Rule is a stable, but not necessarily symmetrical, pattern of relations. Anarchy is an example: rules are not directly responsible for how agents conduct their relationships in an anarchical environment. Nonetheless, rules do guarantee that unintended consequences hold and, when that happens, it is because some agents intend things to be that way and promote rules of different types, which lead to rule of differentthe extent that agents make choices and other agents are affected by them, institutions produce consequences that agents cannot avoid, but they are aware of, and can react to, them. These unintended consequences form a stable pattern of effects on agents.Assertive-rules reinforce the status of rule through ideas and beliefs. Other agents’ acceptance of such ideas and practices promotes indoctrination and constitutes hegemonic rule. Directive-rules, on the other hand, reinforce the positional dimension of rule organised into a vertical chain of command. This is hierarchical rule, which may be formalised into legal rules. Hegemonic ideas reinforce formal hierarchies, resulting in authority or legitimate control.Lastly, commitment-rules reinforce roles defined by and with reference to other roles. Although no role or institution transforms agents into rulers, formal commitment-rules do tend to hierarchy. Overall, roles can produce rule, not because they reinforce other forms of rule, but because agents in association are rulers, even though none of them, in isolation, is, provoking unintended consequences.When agents intend to be dominated by unintended consequences, the result is not anarchy, but heteronomy. Autonomous agents act freely, while heteronomous agents cannot. Agents are always autonomous, but their autonomy is limited by the autonomy of others. Accordingly, heteronomy – autonomy exercised in practice – is a social condition reflected in the international system.Maritime spaces as institutionsTo arrive at a constructivist understanding of maritime spaces as institutions, the analytical toolkit presented should be perceived as it operates in social relations between agents and the socially constituted world out there. As zones of exchange where nations interact politically, maritime spaces should be analysed as socially constituted political spaces. When maritime spaces are considered to be institutions, their social relations can be seen to be guided by speech acts that foster patterns of practices and rules. These patterns reflect agents’ interests and objectives, and lead to the production of outcomes within what are considered to be acceptable expectations.Rules of the three types exist in all institutions. However, the principle of sovereignty makes directive rules scarce. They do appear informally, even though agents may deny their existence. International relations are social relations, and IR analytical framework acknowledges that assumption, which follows from the idea that international anarchy is itself a social arrangement.To say that international relations are anarchical is not to argue that there are no rules on the international plane. Anarchy is a large-scale social arrangement where heteronomy predominates, and agents operate with their autonomy limited by the autonomy of other agents. There is thus a social structure that fosters a stable pattern of unintended consequences relating to state sovereignty that is replicated in maritime spaces and expressed in different legal categorisations.Agent autonomy and the establishment of rule under the influence of rules should be associated with maritime spaces, particularly as regards the freedoms of the high seas and of navigation. These freedoms have been present in political history since at least the writings of Hugo Grotius and were a driving force behind the Great Navigations and the overseas expansion of international society. The very assumption underlying those liberties must be understood as a social construction between agents and social arrangements.Firstly, the sea must be seen as a domain of heteronomous rule where international maritime relations take place. In the maritime space known as the high seas, agents’ autonomy is limited only by the autonomy of other agents. The liberties listed in Article 87 (1) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) are limited by the same liberties of other agents. Categories such as exclusive economic zones and territorial waters are, in turn, manners of ordering maritime space by analogy with terrestrial space and State sovereignty.Part VII of the UNCLOS contains the norms that define agency in maritime spaces for States, whether coastal or land-locked, and also sets out how international maritime relations should take place. As a result, on the high seas, rule is exercised by no particular agent, but by all in association as an unintended consequence of acts that are disordered but legitimised to the extent that agents perceive an overall pattern of unintended consequences.Repeated over time and yielding stable effects among agents, liberty of navigation and liberty of the high seas have produced produce expectations according to the actions of the agents involved. Maritime spaces can be seen to have become institutionalised to suit not only the agents’ intentions, but also the dynamics proper to international relations. That fit with agents’ intentions has also resulted in their being subsumed under constantly dynamic normative frameworks, such as common law. In this case, and interconnected with political practices, the ideal of liberty of navigation has expanded to other related activities, such as overflight, scientific research, island building and cablethe liberty of navigation and freedom of the high seas enabled the European powers – and, during the twentieth century, USA, China, and Russia – to project their power over their areas of influence around the globe. Accordingly, whether to contest the predominance of others or to establish one’s own, the rhetoric of liberty of navigation and freedom of the seas gained stature and strengthened the role of maritime spaces in international relations.Even though it may be argued that the liberty of navigation has benefited only some agents over the course of History (prime examples being the Dutch East India Company, which commissioned the book The Free Sea directly from Grotius, and Wilson’s 14 points, which reflected the USA’s ambitions towards the ports necessary for its international presence), agents gradually perceived the favourable impacts of acting on those premises. Practices became institutionalised and were subsequently reinforced by being formalised in, for instance, the UNCLOS.Also, so as to adjust to the social arrangement that was forming out of international relations, agents introduced new norms and arrangements, which enabled their territorial sovereignty to extend to maritime spaces. The stability of these rules and institutions over time formed a social structure that extended to maritime spaces; that is to say the territorial waters, exclusive economic zones and other arrangements resulting from norms that corroborate the social arrangements dating from the Treaty of Westphalia.Contrary to what is suggested by IR, maritime spaces are used not only as a medium in which to act. There, heteronomous rule is constructed as the way autonomy is exercised constitutes a permissive social condition for agents. That permissiveness indicates that maritime spaces do not constrain agents to act in any certain way, and nor do they prevent agents from doing as they wish. On the other hand, the limitations imposed on them reflect the autonomy of other agents.The construction of IR has marginalised that ethical dimension of maritime spaces. IR insists on considering only the agency of states and of other actors occasionally considered to be agents. On a constructivist reading, however, maritime spaces operate as political zones of exchange among agents, in which reality and the world out there are resignified in such a way as to adjust to the interests, intentions and interactions among agents and between them and the world.Final RemarksThis piece reflects on the marginalisation of maritime spaces in IR and proposes strategies for thinking about them as political zones that affect and influence agents’ behaviour. Constructivism is deployed as an analytical lens through which to understand the role of maritime spaces as institutions. Onuf argues that Constructivism offers a point of departure for looking at the world, as has been done here.For reasons of space, certain questions could not be explored in greater depth, but issues relevant to the proposed analysis were raised. Firstly, there was shown to be a need to consider the high seas in a manner analogous to international anarchy. Both constitute instances of heteronomous rule, where agents’ actions are limited by the autonomy of other agents. This entails seeing this space as a political zone, where liberties and interests interlace and permeate practices and discourses. Complementarily, maritime spaces with different significances for state sovereignty also reflect social arrangements and are resignified according to the distribution of material resources among agents.Also, the liberty of navigation behaves as an institution in that it involves patterns of action that recur over time and also distributes resources asymmetrically among agents. The liberties that result from free navigation are suited to the demands of agents and to established realities, particularly as a result of that asymmetry in capabilities andcontribution to the discussion of Maritime Studies is intended to show the importance of maritime spaces as political zones in IR. In these spaces, agents manifest their interests and pursue their strategies based on the distribution of material and ideational resources. Future studies could investigate the ethical dimension of maritime spaces and how that dimension affects the furtherance of norms and institutions. What has been offered here is a starting point for resignifying investigation of maritime spaces by that literature. This is believed to be a necessary and welcome endeavour. "

Hubris resulting from the unparalleled capabilities of empire blinds leaders from acknowledging the complexities of exerting political control beyond their territory and emboldens them to pursue domination projects that may lead to failure. The widely cited Athenian imperial threat to the Melians – ‘[…] the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept’ (Thucydides 1967, 5.89) – is, in spite of its descriptive value, limited. Sometimes in history, the defeated, due to their very weakness, have prevailed, and the powerful have been rendered incapable despite their might. In Thucydides’s account of the Peloponnesian War, a less acclaimed story reminds of the limits of raw power before lack of control, widespread disobedience, and resistance. At the beginning of the war, a Theban army invaded Plataea, a vulnerable town allied to Athens. Relying on their unmatched potential for violence, the invaders offered an arrangement of subjection to the Plataeans who, fearing the consequences of their refusal, accepted the proposal. What first seemed to be an effortless occupation got the Theban force trapped within the town walls of Plataea, a city invaded yet not controlled. And, when the people realized that their numbers could outweigh the occupiers’ arms, popular and disorganized resistance erupted. The invading army was annihilated, and Thebes withdrew at the unexpected strength of the defeated (Thucydides 1967, 2.2–2.11).Unrivaled capabilities to exert power do not always result in the unchallenged exercise of power. In 1846 and 2001, the United States invaded two territories barely ruled by two weak and fragile states that posed no real threat to the American army. The rising empire of the 19th century advanced almost unimpeded through Mexico, conquering the country and collapsing its political structures. The global pole of power of 2001 captured in a matter of weeks the territory of Afghanistan and dismantled the feeble order that had prevailed since 1996. But these two successful and fast invasions ended in withdrawal. Why does a great power that finds no capable opponent to its imperial actions restrain its expansion and retreat from occupied territories? Superior strength does not ensure domination. The unrestricted victories of the American forces in 1846 and 2001 resulted in the destruction of the structures of domination and control that existed in Mexico and Afghanistan at the time. The disruption of the channels used by the defeated states to exercise at least elemental control over their territories, in both cases, left the United States with barely any means through which it could rule and establish an order of its own, and easy incursions then turned into costly occupations – into wars of attrition – that prompted imperial abdication. When actions of imperialism – either intentionally or inadvertently – result in anarchy, the exercise of empire is hindered.The Strength of the EmpireVast capabilities to exert force are useful to compel specific rivals. Power politics analyses are accurate to consider relative power – the extent to which a certain state’s strength compares to another’s – a core variable in the outcomes of interstate politics (see, for example, Morgenthau 1985, 174–76; Mearsheimer 2001a, 34–36, 42–43). During the American invasions of Mexico in 1846 and Afghanistan in 2001, the greater power of the United States’ armies not only served to easily subjugate two weaker states but also to eventually disband them. Raw power and violence brought sound victories at the initial stages of both wars. However, the appropriate means for achieving conquest and overthrowing local ruling groups might not be as convenient for establishing dominion over captured territories. As George F. Kennan stated at the National War College at the beginning of the Cold War, in 1946:We may defeat the enemy, but life goes on. The demands and aspirations of people, the compulsions that worked on them before they were defeated, begin to operate again after the defeat, unless you can do something to remove them. No victory can really be complete unless you eradicate the people against whom you were fighting or change basically the whole compulsion under which they live (as cited in Gaddis 1982, 39, 40).During imperial occupation, there is no more a clearly defined rival, but a complex network of social relations made of the interactions of heterogeneous groups and interests that cannot be completely subdued nor defeated by mere violence or appearances of power. To control occupied territories, it is necessary to establish political hierarchy among the conquered by either co-opting the existing structures of domination or creating new ones – military strength is notoccupation of Afghanistan ended in 2021 after almost twenty years. At the height of its power, under the discourse of a global war against terrorism, the United States decided to invade a territory controlled almost in its entirety by the Islamist militant group of the Taliban. The main objective of the invasion launched in October 2001, as stated by the Bush administration, was to ‘[…] disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime’ (Bush 2001). Allied with the Afghan Northern Alliance, a political rival of the Taliban emirate, the United States carried a land and air military campaign that decimated an irregular army composed of approximately 45,000 Taliban soldiers and 2,700 al-Qa’eda jihadists. By mid-November, the Taliban had abandoned Kabul and had retreated in the eastern and southern regions of Afghanistan. On November 25, the city of Kunduz surrendered, and, on December 6, the last stronghold of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, Kandahar, had fallen. The Taliban fled and hid in the rough terrain of the country they had controlled.The invasion, however, shattered the domination structures used by the Taliban to control most of Afghanistan. As the American army took over the country, anarchy spread. Despite a swift initial victory, the invading force could not rule over the occupied territory, as no structure upon which to establish domination endured. Thus, the United States was dragged into the anarchical complexities of Afghanistan and what could have been a limited conflict turned into a long war that has cost 73,438 deaths to the coalition led by the United States, 47,245 civilian casualties, and close to $2 trillion to the American government (Knickmeyer 2021). The undesired deadlock that became the occupation of Afghanistan resembles an older event in the history of American imperialism – the Mexican-American War of 1846.In April 1846, President James K. Polk declared war against Mexico, at the time a feeble state eroded by decades of internal strife and international confrontation. The official cause for the war had been an armed incident between Mexican and American troops that occurred in contested territory on the Texan border––‘But now, after reiterated menaces, Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil’ (Polk 1846), stated Polk in his message to the United States Congress on May 11, 1846. However, as historians have found, plans for the invasion preceded such an event and territorial expansion had already been attempted by economic means, but the Mexican government refused to lose more land to its northern neighbor. The first stage of the war was brief. American armies attacked Mexico in a threefold clamp that collapsed the ill-equipped and poorly manned defending forces in the northwestern, northeastern, and western regions of Mexico. By December 1846, the vast and underpopulated northern territory of Mexico was under American occupation; in March 1847, Veracruz – Mexico’s main port – had fallen to the United States Navy; in April, the city of Puebla, neighboring Mexico City, had surrendered to the troops of General Winfield Scott; and, by mid-September, the last fort defending the Mexican capital – Chapultepec Castle – had been defeated. On September 14, as the remains of the Mexican state fled to Queretaro City, the American flag waved in downtown Mexico City. On December 7, 1847, Polk described the invasion to the Congress: ‘History presents no parallel of so many glorious victories achieved by any nation within so short a period. Our Army, regulars, and volunteers have covered themselves with imperishable honors’ (Polk 1847).But, the fast initial victory turned promptly into a stalemate. What could have been a ‘limited’ conflict for capturing just the least-populated half of the Mexican territory, by 1947 had become a widespread war for unclear territorial goals that had already collapsed the existing structures of domination, through which the Mexican state had exercised as much control as it could over the complex political and social realities of the country. As happened in 2001 in Afghanistan, the unmatched power of the invading forces collapsed the political structures that had allowed until then at least rudimentary state control over such intricate and extensive territories. The American armies of 1847 and 2001 were victorious and also stalled. Success had resulted inComplexity of OccupationIn war, invasion is barely the beginning. Occupation, as the history of empires has shown, demands more than brute force. When the Spanish conquistadors took over the Aztec empire in 1521, they were careful to keep the domination structures used by Tenochtitlan so they could use them to build their own imperial rule over Mesoamerica. The Spanish Empire overthrew the dominant power in the region but – either because of lack of force at the time or due to political calculation – did not dismantle the existing hierarchical order; instead, Hernán Cortés ruled through it from Mexico City. In Afghanistan in 2001 and Mexico in 1847, occupation forces did not take advantage of local domination structures but rather obliterated them and, by doing so, got entrapped into the complexities of ‘[…] a particular network-structure in which actors – whether human or corporate – lack authoritative ties with one another or to a common third party’ (i.e. anarchy), as defined by Daniel H. Nexon (2009, 26).John J. Mearsheimer warned in November 2001 that bare military force would not result in an American victory in Afghanistan. Instead, ‘it makes the problem worse. In contrast, a strategy that emphasizes clever diplomacy, intelligence-gathering, and carefully selected military strikes might produce success eventually if we pursue it with patience and tenacity’ (Mearsheimer 2001b). The military defeat of the Taliban that year did not bring control over Afghanistan but rather presented the American coalition with a complicated land where almost no centralized structure for control or domination remained. Efforts to build a new Afghan state from scratch under American control were met by internal political discord and international hesitance. As Carter Malkasian argues in The American War in Afghanistan: A History, overconfidence blinded President Bush’s Cabinet, who deemed an accelerated strategy of state-building in Afghanistan based on a local, broad governing coalition secondary (2021, chap. 5). During the first years of the occupation, the Taliban had profited from the limited reach of the United States in the country and, by 2006, they had regained military strength and popularity among rural sectors of the Afghan population. The lack of political structures over which the occupying forces could implement control over Afghanistan – anarchy – created room for the almost extinct Taliban to maneuver and thrive.Starting in 2009, President Barack Obama sought to reinforce American presence in Afghanistan (Indurthy 2011); however, the advance of the Taliban could not be stopped. By 2016, one-fifth of Afghan territory was either controlled or contested by the Taliban (Almukhtar and Yourish 2016); by 2018, that figure had reached 46% (Gambrell 2021); and, in 2019, when the United States Military decided to stop counting the Taliban advance, it was estimated that 80% of the country could be lost by the end of that year (Zucchino 2019). In mid-August 2021, the full withdrawal of American troops precipitated the collapse of a foreign-backed government that ruled over no genuine domination structure. In twenty years, the outstanding power of the United States has not been sufficient to establish a steady rule in a territory lacking the basic framework over which dominion could be settled. The reach of the American occupation remained trapped within the limits of the cities and along the main roads while most of Afghanistan escaped its control. The Taliban prevailed by surviving in an endless state of war that has drained the United States since 2001.Ralph Waldo Emerson cautioned in 1846: ‘The United States will conquer Mexico, but it will be as the man swallows arsenic, which brings him down in turn. Mexico will poison us’ (Emerson 2001, 514). The war quickly became a poisonous enterprise. General Scott and President Polk’s negotiator, Nicholas Trist, had seen the uncontested advance of the American army over Mexico with preoccupation. They feared the Mexican state would not be able to survive an unrestricted attack, and, as war opponents had warned, the United States would thus be forced to choose between ‘hav[ing] to drop the war, or annex[ing] a country…’ (Brent 1954, 463). By September 1847, the invasion had succeeded but the occupation had just started. The invading forces had collapsed the fragile political structures over which the Mexican state subsisted and had seized a territory that they were incapable of neither ruling nor controlling by themselves. Popular resistance met the occupiers throughout the country, improvised and unrelated guerrillas appeared across the newly conquered land to oppose the American presence, and, as the war reached a deadlock, indiscipline arose among the ranks of the United States Army and the cost of the war started to take its toll on the treasury and President Polk’s position in American politics.the unexpected consequences of the invasion, General Scott and Mr. Trist rushed to secure an agreement with the improvised new Mexican government – which came to be the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo – to prevent the continuation of an interminable war of occupation and to avoid the complete annexation of the anarchical territory south of the Rio Grande, a decision that had the potential to drain the political and economic capabilities of the rising American empire. President Polk, who by the time, as he recorded in his diary, was ‘decidedly in favor of insisting on the acquisition of more territory than the provinces named [at the beginning of the invasion]’ (Polk 1845, September 4, 1847), saw in this arrangement a solution to a war that had become undesirable and decided to approve the text of the Treaty. Mexico had survived because of its very weakness. The Mexican chaos had hindered complete annexation, and the rising imperial power had fled the unintended trap of anarchy.ConclusionThe lack of domination structures through which imperial or state power can be exerted – anarchy – strains the capabilities of the occupying force and renders them futile. What at first comes as an untroublesome military triumph may quickly degenerate into an entrapping war of imperial attrition and turn the occupied land into a ‘graveyard of empires.’ Weakness drew the hubris of the Thebans inside the walls of Platea and also operated for the town’s unexpected survival. The American wars in Mexico and Afghanistan were lost not to a certain military force but to the structural might of anarchy. The strength of empire is useless in the draining environment of anarchic network structures – and that may be the reason for imperial powers to incessantly seek the imposition of order."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/06/who-are-the-taliban/,Who Are the Taliban?,Grant Farr,Sep 6 2021,"On August 15, 2021, the Taliban stormed into Kabul after capturing all the key cities in Afghanistan. The Afghan military collapsed, fleeing their posts and giving up their guns and equipment. Many of the Afghan leaders fled, including President Ashraf Ghani. The Taliban’s arrival in Kabul was much quicker than most had predicted, leaving thousands of people, including American citizens and Afghans who had assisted the Americans, in danger. Chaos occurred as thousands attempted to flee the Taliban by catching flights out of the Kabul airport as the American and NATO soldiers attempted to bring order to the chaos.Many questions remain, including what kind of government the Taliban will assemble, whether the new government will include current or past leaders of Afghanistan, how the new Taliban government will be received by other nations in the world, and how they will treat vulnerable groups in Afghanistan including women, and religious and ethnic minorities. The real questions are who are the Taliban of today and how have they changed in the 20 years since they ruled Afghanistan? While the Taliban say that they are not the Taliban of old and are now more tolerant and accepting of women and religious minorities, their actions seem to indicate otherwise. What do we know about the Taliban and how will they rule?Women and the TalibanAfghanistan is a traditional Islamic society in which the role of women has always been restricted. However, the treatment of women became more restricted when the Taliban held power in Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. Under Taliban rule at that time, women were not allowed to work, attend school, or even leave their homes without a male relative accompanying them. Women were required to wear the all-encompassing burka, a veil that covers the entire body with a small, embroidered opening for women to look through.Women who did not follow the Taliban’s directives or did not wear the burka were beaten by flogging or even stoning. Many women during that time were killed (Kirby, 2021).Although the bombing of the World Trade Center Towers and the Pentagon were the main reasons for American and NATO forces entering Afghanistan in the Fall of 2001, the treatment of women has also been cited as a factor. “The central goal of the terrorists is the brutal oppression of women…” President George Bush said in December 2001 while the United States was gearing up for its invasion of Afghanistan (Kirby, 2021). In November of that year shortly after the United States invaded Afghanistan, Laura Bush said that “The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women” (Kirby, 2021). In 2010 Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a group of female Afghan ministers: “We will not abandon you, we will stand with you always” (Kirby,looking back after 20 years of United States involvement in Afghanistan, it appears that women have greatly benefited from the American and NATO occupation. More girls are in school. There were over 9.5 million students in school in 2020, of which almost 40 percent were girls (Kirby, 2021). There are more women in suchl jobs as journalists, teachers, and doctors. In the 2004 Afghan constitution 27 percent of the seats in the “House of the People”, essentially the lower house of parliament, are set aside for women.As a result, there are more women in the Afghan congress than in the United States House of Representatives (Mohamed, 2018).But these gains have largely come in Kabul and a few other major cities. In fact, the condition of Afghan women in much of Afghanistan has improved very little in the last 20 years. Consider these facts. A 2020 report by Amnesty International found that Afghan women, even those with high political or social status, are harassed, threatened, and even killed. Amnesty International ranks Afghanistan as the world worst place to be a woman (Thompson, 2020). This report documents “attacks on schoolgirls and working women who dare to venture out into the public sphere; high levels of rape and domestic violence, as well as widespread physical and domestic abuse by state forces; forced and child marriage; and honor killings” (Thompson, 2020). In addition, the report cites that despite billions of dollars spend on women’s education, 87 per cent of Afghan women remain illiterate (Thompson, 2020).The United Nations Development Program’s 2020 annual report ranks Afghanistan as one of the worst nations for women. The UNDP 2020 report shows thatmany Afghan women die in childbirth, that women are often married at a young age, and although more women are going to school, there are still many women who are not able or are not allowed to go to school (UNDP, 2020).In fact, some senior United States officials have argued that the role of women in Afghan society had become a “pet rock in our rucksack taking us down,” (Kirby, 2021) indicating that many American officials saw the fight for the role of women in society was a lost cause. In addition, apparently the CIA exchanged Viagra pills for intelligence on the Taliban so that in the words of an Afghan journalist, “old men can rape their wives with American blessing” (Kirby, 2021).The Taliban view of womenThe Taliban’s policy with regards to women has not been clearly laid out. In the face of international condemnation, the Taliban seems to be trying to paint a positive picture to the international community regarding its treatment of women. The Taliban has stated that women would be allowed to work and go to school, “according to Islamic law” (Kirby, 2021).Regarding women’s education on August 31, 2021, the Taliban Minister of Education, Abdul Baqi Haqqani, reported “The…people of Afghanistan will continue their higher education in light of Sharia law in safety without being in a mixed male female environment” (Crane, 2021). He went to say that the Taliban want to “create a reasonable and Islamic curriculum that is in line with Islamic and historical values and, on the other hand, be able to compete with other countries” (Crane, 2021).However, it is not clear what Islamic law, or Sharia law, means in this context and what it says about the treatment of women. In fact, the treatment of women varies widely across the Islamic world from very restrictive to relatively open. In Iran, for instance, an Islamic theocracy, there are more women in schools and universities than men and there are many women professionals, including doctors and professors. In Turkey, another Islamic country, women attend school with men. Even in relatively conservative Islamic countries such as Pakistan, which has had a woman prime minister, women play important roles, attend schools, and universities. The phrase “Islamic Law” means veryaddition, although the Taliban’s view of women may seem particularly draconian, it is not inconsistent with that of many traditional Afghans. Despite the rapid urbanization in Afghanistan in the last few decades over 70 percent of Afghans continue to live in rural areas, where traditional views of gender roles are not inconsistent with the those of the Taliban. This is especially the case in the Pashtun areas of Afghanistan, the area from which the Taliban emerged and where the Taliban ideology is more closely aligned with local traditions and customs. In traditional Afghan society the situation of women is hard, difficult, and dangerous. In the rural areas of Afghanistan women are expected to marry young, to produce many male children, and to work in the fields at a young age.In addition, in traditional Afghan society, men can have up to four wives.What the Taliban really mean when they say that women will be subjected to “Islamic law”, is that the role of women will be subject to Pashtu tribal law. At its core, the Taliban is a Pashtu tribal movement and many of its objectives and actions are consistent with the tribal codes of behaviors, sometimes referred to as “Pashtunwali”.These tribal codes specify obligations of honor, hospitality, revenge, and the treatment of women. Such strong tribal structures and codes of behavior are not found among non-Pashtun groups In Afghanistan. For instance, among the Hazara or Tajik ethnic groups the role of women is much more progressive.While the Taliban have been in power in Kabul for only a few days, we already have an idea of how women will be treated. A female TV anchor in Kabul was not allowed to work. The Taliban told her “You are not allowed to work, go home” (Kirby, 2021). At the Herat women’s university, female students and faculty were sent home. There are reports of Taliban going door to door looking for unmarried women between the ages of 14 to 45 to marry off to Taliban soldiers. Time will tell how women will do under Taliban rule. But the early signs are not good.Religious and Ethnic MinoritiesThe Taliban treatment of religious minorities in Afghanistan, especially Shi’a Moslems, is problematic, despite claims to the contrary. In the months before the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, the Taliban produced a propaganda video on al-Emarah, the Taliban news agency, featuring the Shi’a religious leader, Mawlawi Mahdi Mujahid and one of the few Hazara Taliban members. The video urged the Shi’a to join the Taliban’s effort to drive out the American invaders (Kazmin, 2021). The message was meant to reassure Afghan Shia, as well as Iran, that they had no reason to fear the return of the Taliban.Shi’ism is a branch of Islam that follows the descendants of the Prophet Mohammed, whom they consider sacred. Shi’a are found throughout the Islamic world.Shi’ism is the state religious of Iran. Shi’a are also found in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and the Yemen. The Shi’a in Afghanistan, who are mostly of the Hazara ethnic group, have much to fear from the Taliban. They constitute about 15 to 20 percent of the Afghan population. The Hazara are thought to descend from 13th Century warriors of Genghis Khan. They converted to Islam in the late 13th Century when this area was controlled by Iran. Historically, they have been persecuted in Afghanistan since the time of Abdur-Rahman Khan in the late 1800.Historically the heartland of the Hazara is in the high mountains of Central Afghanistan, however in the last several decades many have moved to Kabul where they live in an area called Dasht-e Barchi (Farr,recently, they have been persecuted by the Taliban who consider Shi’a not to be true Muslims. During the previous rule of the Taliban between 1996 and 2001, there were at least three large scale massacres of Hazara civilians, including the massacre of hundreds of Hazara men in Mazar-i Sharif in 1998. Several Iranian diplomats were killed in that event as well. Even after the Taliban had been driven out of Afghanistan in 2001 attacks on Hazara continued. Buses traveling between Kabul and the Hazarajat, as the Hazara area of Afghanistan is called, were often stopped and Hazara, who can be identified by their Central Asian features, were pulled from buses, and killed.With the current return of the Taliban the Hazara are again facing persecution.Between July 4–6 2021, six Hazara men were killed by Taliban fighters in the village of Mundarakht, in the Malistan district of Ghazni Province. Six of the men were shot to death, and three others were tortured to death, including one man who was strangled with his own scarf and had his arm muscles sliced off (Callamard, 2021). On August 30, 2021 the Taliban shot 14 Hazara men, including 12 surrendered soldiers and two civilians in the Khadir district of Daykundi Province.ConclusionAs of the writing of this article, the Taliban have been in power for a short number of weeks. We still do not know what the Taliban will do, how they will form a government, or how they will rule Afghanistan. They have to date, given mixed signals, at one time appearing moderate and at other times appearing violent and intolerant. The Taliban soldiers that appear on the streets seem to be operating independently from the leadership. However, there are many Afghans who have much to fear. These include, among others, women and the Shi’a. So far the future does not look promising."

Beer and Robert Hariman,Sep 6 2021,"Thucydides in Afghanistan: Imperial Abstraction, Moral Displacement, and HubrisDespite twenty years and two trillion dollars, the Afghan government fell in a matter of days following the US military pullback in August 2021. The media exploded into a maelstrom of finger pointing and hand wringing; a photograph of a Chinook helicopter above the US Embassy provided a visual suture with the fall of Saigon. It’s déjà vu all over again. More reflective articles strived to provide some nuance, but these and other attempts at lessons learned are swept away in the deluge. What can be better understood, however, is how the astonishment at the fall, the rush to judgment, and perhaps the mission failure itself reflect habits of imperial abstraction, moral displacement, and hubris. This article draws on Thucydides’ History of the Peloponnesian War, a canonical text in International Relations (IR), to foreground these three habits—deeply embedded in the rhetoric of classical realism, but also attributes of Western imperialism. They coalesce as part of a political discourse—a way of speaking, thinking, acting, reacting, knowing, and not-knowing—but also operate piecemeal and usually on behalf of not paying attention.In 2020, the major US television networks devoted a total of five minutes to Afghanistan (Lobe, 2021). Whether the failure at nation building in Afghanistan was due to misguided idealism or not, and whether media commentators have been consistent in their coverage before and after the fall or not, the long acquiescence to the occupation and quick reactions at its demise reflect a shared inattentiveness that is discursively constructed. Thucydides’ provides a mirror that can reflect these specific tendencies in imperial power as it manifests across a spectrum from theoretical debate to democratic public opinion.Thucydides TodayAccording to some in IR, it’s time to move on. More than time: As Edward Keene (2015, 366) observes, “the critical literature, for all its undoubtedly penetrating insight into the History of the Peloponnesian War, does not, however, seriously challenge the grip that Thucydides still exerts on the historical imagination of international relations” To the critics, Thucydides represents flawed conventions, tired pedagogy, and intellectual complacency. The world today is not the Greek (Athenian) world of the fifth century BCE, universalism is itself an imperial power move, difference and standpoint matter, and disciplinary knowledge should be decentered. We agree. Even so, attention to failure—in both politics and inquiry—cautions against scrapping resources for critical analysis. Indeed, the history of interpretation of the History provides an impressive review of the importance and complexity of the text (cf. Kouskouvelis, 2019; Allison,2018; Johnson, 2015; Keene, 2015; Williams, 2013; Moylon, 2013 Monten, 2006; Clark, 1993; Welch, 2003; Strassler, 1996; Bagby, 1994; Doyle, 1990; Garst, 1989; Alker 1988).These accounts also demonstrate how disciplinary appropriations have included both radical simplifications and nuanced theoretical arguments, so much so that Thucydides now can also be understood to be a critic of political realism (cf. Rahe, 2007; Ahrensdorf, 1995; Forde, 1995) and one model for constructivist theory (cf. Jaffe, 2017; Zumbrunnen, 2015; Lebow,find the critique of realism—and particularly as it is supported by scholarship in classics (e.g., Connor 1984)—to be decisive, but something else is at stake here. Whether labeled “realism,” “imperialism,” or something else, the History displays specific discursive tropes that still are deployed to rationalize power and failures of power. Unlike the tight composition of that text, however, these tropes are dispersed over time and throughout public culture. They become habits, not stratagems; reflexes, not decisions. And those who use them benefit from this lack of awareness. One result is that it then is easy to look past them in Thucydides’ text. In what follows, we review a well-known episode to identify some contemporary habits of inattention.The Paradigmatic Scene: Athenian Generals at MelosMelos is the paradigmatic scene, the ideal type: the place where one can see in starkest outline the logic of self-interested domination in a state of nature, the harsh discipline of rational calculations of power, and the folly of relying instead on aspirational factors such as civic values and common moral decency. The narrative simplicity of the dialogue can be misleading, however. As Robert Connor (1984, 147-157) has demonstrated, setting the scene within the themes and narrative of the History shifts the implied author’s perspective from that of either objective documentation or theoretical endorsement to a critical stance: we observe the Melians make the wrong decision, and how the Athenians are turning into tyrants. The History becomes a story of how the Athenians became power maximizers, and how they learned that lesson so well that they lost their national identity, their capacity to make good political decisions, and the war (cf. Connor, 1984, 156-157).Realist valorization of the dialogue has depended on a less contextual reading. In between these two interpretations, the Melian Dialogue has still more to teach us. One reason the scene has become paradigmatic is that it so quickly transcends its historical location. The scene is geared for abstraction. Its variation from Thucydides’ usual compositional techniques is the first clue—not least by anonymizing the speakers—and these stylistic changes affect a modal shift, a change in validity conditions of the sort affected by a trope. The reader is being moved into a conception of international politics that is fundamentally abstract; in doing so, it reveals some of how abstraction can become a mentality that displaces moral values and carries illicit motives. Abstraction is unavoidable, of course, but it is not innocent (Krishna, 2001; van Wingerden, 2017; Behr and Kirke, 2014). As the generals are the epitome of rationality, they also are invoking an attitude that otherwise would be Persian, the political and cultural antithesis of the Greek world (Connor 1984, 157).As they are figures of rational self-interest calculating the preponderance of power in action, they also are caught in an undercurrent of hubris.Melos, a Dorian polity in the unenviable position of being on an island midway between Athens and Sparta, had wisely opted for neutrality in the war between the two powers. Athenian predations pushed them into open alliance with the Spartans, and the Athenians then besieged the city. The negotiation regarding surrender is presented as a dialogue behind closed doors, and it concerns few specific features of the Melian situation. Instead, Melos is moved into an abstract space for purely rational analysis. Several steps effect this shift. The first is to disable any other basis for judgment by associating it with mere speech. “We on our side will use no fine phrases saying, for example, that we have a right to our empire … or that you have never done us any harm” (Thucydides, 1972, 5.89). Two great principles of the Greek Enlightenment—reason and eloquence—are parsed, with one set over the other. All appeals to right, justice, reciprocity, or any other value then are reduced to “a great mass of words nobody would believe.” Note that these other factors also would require giving more attention to the actual situation of Melos and Athens as well as other factors for prudential judgment, not least the lack of strategic necessity, recent history of provocation, and shared political values. The Athenians require another standard: “Instead, we recommend that you should try to get what it is possible for you to get, taking into consideration what we both really do think; since you know as well as we do that, when these matters are discussed by practical people, the standard of justice depends on the quality of power to compel and that in fact the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept.” One can see here the standard conceptions of scene, actors, and rational decision-making that govern politicalfactor in the immediate political situation has been abstracted into a single, universal, and highly reductive calculation. The only “real” consideration is calculating rational self-interest within a hierarchy of power, while setting everything else aside. To do otherwise is to be delusional. The Melians immediately see the danger and attack at precisely the key point: taking a long view of history that imagines a reversal of the Athenian fortunes, they offer a competing universal standard of “fair play and just dealing,” i.e., of a sense of moral and political reciprocity that admittedly falls short of “mathematical accuracy” (Thucydides, 1972, 5.90). The Athenian reply involves a long segue into imperial insouciance and a perverse psychology of empire whereby the strong have to oppress the weak, along with other themes of the History such as the predominance of sea power (and thus some acknowledgement of the specific situation at Melos), but everything is bent back into the iron frame of abstraction.This figural structure then acquires its most important undergirding: the claim that the Athenian decision is no decision at all but rather a law of nature. “It is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can. This is not a law we made ourselves, nor were we the first to act upon it when it was made. We found it already in existence, and we shall leave it to exist for ever among those who come after us. We are merely acting in accordance with it, and we know that you or anybody else with the same power as ours would be acting in precisely the same way” (Thucydides, 1972, 5.105). The abstraction of power is complete: it is a transhistorical phenomenon and the sure determination of human behavior—that is, the law applies to all actors in all situations in which power matters. Choice is still possible, but only to act in accord with the law or destroy oneself by willfully violating it. Thus, the Melians face two dangers: the actual preponderance of power in action, and the potential of their own rhetoric of liberty, reciprocity, and hope to delude them. Power is not inflected by history or morality, culture or personality, empire or ethnicity, or by anything else; these other factors become either subjective or epiphenomenal.This triumph of reason over the “fine phrases” of civic eloquence is also a premier example of language being weaponized. The History reflects the foundational debate in the Greek Enlightenment about the relationship between language and power, with Thucydides (like Pericles) obviously having learned a great deal from the sophists. What he saw, and modern commentators typically miss, is that setting reason over speech was the most successful rhetorical strategy of them all, and that it became a premier instrument for severing power from morality, rationalizing excessive power, and justifying crimes against humanity. For that to happen, however, speech had to seem either transparent or delusional, reason had to be narrowly circumscribed, and power had to be abstract. Likewise, politics had to imagined as a state of nature, and its structures and actors subject to laws of nature.This statement of classical realism contains another device, however, that too often goes unnoticed. The explicit standoff between morality and self-interest (e.g., Thucydides, 1972, 5.104; 5.107) does more than identify the reasons given for Athenian brutality and the cause of Melian miscalculation. The Athenians’ account has taken a strange step in the history of power: instead of exalting their position of dominance, or of taking the second spot in a divine hierarchy, they have set themselves beside a law of nature. Perhaps their aversion to monarchy played a role in this development of political reason, but not to protect anyone against tyranny. They are now exempt from responsibility for their actions. That responsibility has been transferred to the hierarchy, the instantiation of the natural law of the strong dominating the weak. (To anticipate another realist argument, the weak learning to band together against the strong only adds another source of power while reinscribing the hierarchy.) Were they exalting their power, they might be expected to exhibit magnanimity (a virtue targeted by Machiavelli, by the way); were they uniquely reflecting the favor of the gods, they might be expected to share those blessings. Instead, in the abstract space of abstract power, following a law that suffuses all of nature, they become bystanders to their own behavior.The sleight of hand works in part because of how close it seems to an ethical intelligence: one is detached rather than egocentric, observing one’s actions from a separate, dispassionate standpoint, and not claiming special powers or privilege beyond what nature provides. However, Thucydides seems at pains to show that the bystander trope is a figure of hubris. Only the powerful claim to have this special knowledge, or at least to accept its discipline andseeming rationality is also an algorithm for overextension. The Athenians neither respect tradition nor learn from history, and they are repeatedly portrayed as bold: behavior that, via the rhetorical figure of paradiastole (the reframing of vice as virtue), also can be described as rash. Most important, as the Athenians speak of their power, the signs of their destruction already are evident. Their hubris and collective delusion will become paramount as they decide to invade Sicily, just as their rationality and rhetorical skill would be undone by an almost comic sequence of events in the public debate to authorize the invasion. What also is necessary, however, is the blindness already is in place at Melos; indeed, the placement of this otherwise inconsequential scene immediately prior to the Syracuse invasion narrative will not have been an accident (Connor, 1984, 150, 154-155). Contemporary critiques converge on this point: the fatal flaw in the Athenian conception of power is a lack of self-restraint (Nation 2012; Korab-Karpowicz, 2006; Monoson and Loriaux 1998; Ahrensdorf 1995; Forde 1995). Once power is abstract, universal, and grounded in a state of nature, it becomes incapable of internal moderation. Becoming a bystander of one’s own conduct confirms the shift: power now operates autonomously. At that point, hubris dominates the field.By contrast, the morality that the Athenians jettisoned at the beginning of the dialogue (among the “mass of words nobody would believe”) was not power’s opposite, but its only basis for becoming self-limiting. (Thucydides considers self-interest as a means of self-restraint there and at Mytilene, but it proves susceptible to hubris.) Ironically, the Athenians, like imperialists everywhere, were happy to advise others on the need to accept constraint. By placing the Melian Dialogue in the larger, tragic story, Thucydides reveals how the realist definition of reality is a strategic blunder. The lesson is not that the strong should rule others, but that unless the strong rule themselves, they will become the authors of their own destruction.Kabul and Lessons Not LearnedPerhaps the realists among the Afghans got out early, rather than trusting in luck, hope, or the Americans. Soon the media will turn elsewhere, the Afghan women will be ignored again, and other events will lead to other interventions. The loss of Afghanistan is a catastrophe for many Afghans, but collateral damage for the US, only another example of lives and treasure unnecessarily lost.The uproar across the political spectrum of the past few weeks is the flip side of a persistent amnesia, a systematic form of “non-knowing” that is typical of imperial power and not incidentally embedded deeply within political realism (cf. Mills 2007). More specifically, that ignorance is a side-effect of abstraction, moral displacement, and hubris: discursive tropes that have become imperial habits. It should not be easy to drop two trillion dollars in a twenty-year war, but it was almost effortless politically in the aftermath of 9/11. An attack on American soil justified a military response and the vast mission creep that followed. Now we will be told again that it is important to pay attention to what was happening on the ground, to take culture seriously, to negotiate rather than dictate terms, to have an exit strategy. These lessons will be re-learned, and then forgotten, again (cf. Rose, 2011). Were they remembered, there would be less reason to read Thucydides.Following Timothy Ruback’s (2015) account of the “Thucydides function,” we recognize how, for better or worse, the text continues to be used as a discourse for disciplinary legitimation. That reach extends even to what Rubeck (following Jacques Derrida) labels “the discipline to come,” or how a yearning for the future discipline can shape—and limit—the present configuration. That aspiration is widely shared today, and perhaps comfort can be taken in numbers; obviously, a great deal of work is being done to reset the human sciences more explicitly on the right side of history. Even so, new schools remain formally proximate to old schools, not least in how abstract conceptions of power are essential constructs within a transdisciplinary critical apparatus. Rhetorical self-reflection might include attention to how relying on abstractions can reinscribe habits of inattention.Thucydides can be instructive in helping us to see that realism can be turned inside out: instead of declaring a severe normative hierarchy to be a state of nature, human nature is revealed to be that and more—both inevitable competition and a capacity for restraint on behalf of mutual advantage. What was hidden within the abstract conception of power as natural domination—national character, moral choice, and the value of sharing power—can be reworked to become a strategy for mutually beneficial co-existence. “Power” suppresses what would limit it; the paradox is that survival requires restraint, whether external orotherwise, “non-knowing” is essential for imperial overreach, while restraint and a recognition of limits can be a path for transforming ignorance into knowledge and prudence (Beer and Hariman, 2013). Any capacity for reliable, reasonable, internal constraint will come from engagement with the social world that had been abstracted out of the realist political calculus. By fusing abstraction, moral displacement, and hubris, discourse leads toward a future of domination and self-destruction. By paying attention to these tropes, one can recognize what had been ignored or forgotten, again and again."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/05/creating-legitimacy-in-a-pluralist-world-order/,Creating Legitimacy in a Pluralist World Order,Terry Macdonald,Sep 5 2021,"Talk of political legitimacy crises in world politics is nothing new, but over recent years it has become pervasive. While international institutions confront deepening challenges from anti-globalist political forces, domestic liberal and democratic institutions are facing legitimacy crises of their own, reflected in the rise of autocratic rulers and populist movements around the world. Varying local factors always contribute to these crises; but they are also partly products of longer-range historical processes, which have shaped the decline of the ‘statist’ global political order, and the modern concepts and practices of legitimacy that developed alongside it. Since the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, and the publication of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan just three years later, the pursuit of legitimacy in political institutions has been inextricably tied to the consolidation of sovereign authority – both internally within nations, and externally among states. But over the last century, intensifying forces of global integration have transformed sovereign structures of governing authority, without accompanying changes to models of political legitimation.In his circa-1930 Prison Notebooks, Antonio Gramsci diagnosed the European political crises of his time as the product of such epochal fault-lines between legitimate political orders, whereby ‘[t]he old is dying and the new cannot be born’ (Gramsci, 1971). Nearly a century on, Nancy Fraser has invoked these words in her recent book of this same name, to capture her diagnosis of our present legitimacy crises (Fraser, 2019). While the 21st century’s governing institutions continue to evolve under pressure from complex and globalized social and economic relationships, the parallel development of a new global legitimacy system is thus cast by many as politically out of reach. This growing gulf between the legitimacy demands of contemporary governing institutions, and the capacity of statist liberal and democratic practices to deliver, has led many commentators to adopt a counsel of despair. In his book After Liberalism, for instance, Immanuel Wallerstein predicted that the coming era of world politics will, due to world-systemic changes, ‘be short on peace, short on stability, and short on legitimacy’ (Wallerstein, 1995).Amidst the complex dynamics of contemporary political crises, we can, however, find the kernel of a more optimistic vision of the emerging global era – in which the old ‘statist’ order and its legitimation practices may be dying, but it is no longer true that the new cannot be born. We can find potential here for a new imaginary of political order and legitimacy that is not statist but rather pluralist in its organizing structure (Macdonald and Macdonald, 2020). But its realization will require something close to a paradigm shift in our thinking about political order and legitimacy – in which statist understandings of the problem, concept, normative grounds, and institutional standards for achieving legitimate political governance are all dismantled, and a new pluralist configuration of ideas rebuilt in their place.The rise and decline of ‘statist’ legitimacyMaking a shift of this kind first requires establishing some common conceptual ground on which to pivot, by articulating a more abstract understanding of the problem and idea of legitimacy. The first clear legitimacy problem-diagnosis was made in the political writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (Rousseau, 1997; 2018). As Rousseau described it, legitimacy is the remedy for a distinctive political problem – arising from tension between a normative aspiration to self-determination, on the one hand, and empirical constraints of inextricable social interdependence and plurality, on the other. Legitimation processes thus aim to establish normative grounds for free political agents to support shared governance institutions – under conditions whereby they are forced together in interdependence through shared social structures, while facing persistent disputes over political interests and moral values. The concept of political ‘legitimacy’ associated with this problem denotes the support-worthiness of governance institutions, as vehicles for collectivemain legitimation practices that developed through the modern period can be described as ‘statist’, insofar as they are centred on governance institutions of sovereign states – including both the internal legitimacy of domestic state governance, and the external legitimacy of sovereign states in international society. At a normative level, statist legitimation practices empower the exercise of rationalist political intelligences: instrumental reason, through preference aggregation or contractual bargaining; moral reason, via public justification; and communicative reason, in the form of open dialogue aimed at mutual understanding. At an institutional level, they function by harnessing collective rationalities through the application of rule–based standards, of the kind familiar from modern technocratic, liberal, and democratic institutions. Since these statist legitimation practices have developed alongside modern political theories over several centuries, they are commonly viewed as theoretically inseparable from the concept of ‘legitimacy’ itself. But while this statist imaginary of legitimate political order has proven theoretically resilient, its capacity to sustain successful legitimation practices is now in steady decline.Underlying this decline is a structural transformation of the three constitutive elements of legitimacy problems. First, the aspirations to self-determination that give normative impetus to legitimation projects are increasingly pursued through a more heterogenous range of social collectives than the city-based or national societies of early-modern Europe. Individuals making legitimacy claims against governing institutions now mobilise politically through a plurality of identity- and interest-based associations, spanning local and transnational levels. Second, the forms of interdependence that constrain individual self-determination – creating pressures towards collective governance and legitimation – are increasingly complex and dynamic, reflecting rapidly-changing patterns of integration and fragmentation across social, cultural, and economic spheres. Third, the forms of social plurality that challenge agreement on the institutional terms of collective political governance and legitimation are deep and persistent. The 20th century liberal hope that normative disputes in political life could be successfully overcome through stronger national integration, or cultivation of stronger cosmopolitan moralities and identities, seems increasingly implausible the deeper we advance into the 21st century.Taken together, these structural changes mark out what can be described as a shift from a ‘statist’ to a ‘pluralist’ global political order. The institutional instruments of legitimation developed for a system of sovereign states are no longer able to function as vehicles for rationalist modes of collective self-determination, as envisaged in statist imaginaries. At the root of this failure is the reliance of collective rationalities on forms of social closure and stability that have been systematically eroded through the era of globalization. Legitimacy standards designed to harness collective instrumental rationalities – such as procedures for empowering social contracting, preference aggregation through elections, or technocratic administration – rely on a reasonable degree of stability in the shared interests within collectives. In turn, the shared interests are more difficult to sustain in the complex and dynamic context of the contemporary pluralist order. Standards aimed at advancing shared global moral rationalities – through articulations of global constitutional principles, public justifications, or rights protections – now run up against persistent and vociferous forms of moral disagreement, as the cosmopolitan moral ambitions of late 20th century liberals face challenges from emerging powers outside the liberal-Western sphere. The standards designed to empower communicative rationalities – through discursive exchange and inclusive deliberation – are undermined by the fragmentation of public spheres through new media technologies and patterns of social mobility, creating pervasive distortions and exclusions in communicative relationships.Towards ‘pluralist’ legitimacy: The promise of political creativityThese growing functional failures of statist legitimation push us towards a different kind of political imaginary, which may better ameliorate legitimacy problems as they are constituted within the 21st century’s emerging ‘pluralist’ world order. At the foundation of this new imaginary, there must be a shift in how the normative grounds of legitimacy are understood – to move beyond the modern preoccupation with rationalist forms of collective intelligence and self-determination, and further recognize the legitimizing potential of creative political intelligences.The idea that legitimation may require some capacity for creativity is not itself new; political theorists since Rousseau have understood that more is required for legitimation than mechanistic processes of calculation and rule-application, or linguistically-structured communication. We can find appeals to creativity in many different texts and traditions of thought on legitimacy: the ‘divine’ creative authority of Rousseau’s constitution-making ‘lawgiver’ (Rousseau, 2018); the creative forces of cultural production in romantic and nationalist political thought; the creative associational relationships of late 19th and early 20th century anarchist, syndicalist, and pluralist activist-authors; the creatively experimental inquiry in the classical pragmatist thought of Williams James (1909) and John Dewey (1938); the creative power of Weber’s ‘charismatic’ domination (Weber, 1978); the politico-economic associationalism of Hayek’s (1960) ‘spontaneous order’ and Popper’s (2020) ‘open society’ liberal visions; and the creative force of collective self-constitution in Hannah Arendt (1958), and in the thinking of some later republicans and deliberative democrats. But what is missing from these theoretical reflections is any systematic analysis of how creativity might – like rationality – be treated as an ordinary feature of everyday human intelligence, which can be cultivated, harnessed, and empowered through the deliberate political interventions of legitimacy ‘standards’ to strengthen legitimacy in governance institutions.Arguably, the closest we have come so far to the development of an explicit institutional agenda for creativity-driven political legitimation was in the development of ‘pluralist’ associational theories and practices in the first three decades of the 20th century – among the various liberal, anarchist, syndicalist, and pragmatist political theorists and activists of that period (see Macdonald and Macdonald, 2020). But these pragmatist and pluralist political movements fell out of intellectual fashion from the 1930s onwards, as realist and liberal variants of rationalist political theory rose to prominence as frameworks for understanding and steering the Great Power conflicts and institutional projects of the 20th century’s middle decades. Pragmatist and pluralist insights about creative human intelligence took on a new life of their own, however, in the last century’s new disciplinary fields of psychology, education, and organizational science. These fields have fostered a proliferation of research on the character, development, and social preconditions of human creativity – and the ways in which it can be fostered through well-designed institutional interventions, as an engine of social progress (see Kaufman and Sternberg,theoretical and empirical understandings of creativity have underpinned the development of many influential approaches to pedagogy and entrepreneurship that are now entrenched as orthodox practices within 21st century educational and business institutions. But they have not yet been re-integrated back into the theories and practices of political governance and legitimation, in connection with which they first emerged. Instead, liberal and democratic theorists over last century have focused on building sophisticated models of the legitimating functions of political reason and rationality – in its varied instrumental, moral, and communicative forms – even as the real-world legitimacy of liberal and democratic institutions has steadily declined. What is needed now, accordingly, is a new systematic effort to revive the pluralist innovations that were emerging a century ago – and to develop them with the benefit of the rich scientific understandings of creativity that have by now been established across other social-scientific fields.This political challenge raises the practical question: what institutional agenda could serve to foster new legitimation processes grounded in the empowerment of creative political intelligences? Just as legitimation within a statist order is pursued through institutional standards designed to support the functioning of collective rational decision-making and action, so too must legitimation within a pluralist order develop institutional instruments designed to empower collective forms of creative intelligence. More specifically, what is required is the development of a new range of institutional standards aimed not at fostering compliance with rationally-validated rules, but rather at supporting three key functions of creative collective action: adaptation (to change); innovation (of new collective value); and social accommodation (across persistent social difference).These three creative functions can be contrasted directly with the functions of rational collective action that ground statist legitimation. Whereas instrumentally rational legitimation aims at aligning institutional rules with the shared strategic interests of political agents, creative legitimation aims instead to build capacities for adaptation to changing patterns of aligned or divergent interest – fostering flexible political relationships and agile institutional capabilities. Whereas morally rational legitimation aims to secure compliance with some publicly-articulated moral ground-rules for global governance, creative legitimation aims instead to build capacities for normative innovation – such that fundamental norms can be contextually re-articulated to fit the problems and self-understandings of political collectives in each new situation. And whereas communicatively rational legitimation aims to reach consensus on political decisions through shared deliberative processes, creativity builds capacities for social accommodation of persistent disagreements – finding flexible ways to compromise or co-exist with others in the absence of full or stablethe functional aims of political legitimation in this way may point towards a range of more concrete institutional reforms and political interventions, capable of supplementing the legitimacy delivered through the rationalist instruments of ‘statist’ legitimacy. First, this reorientation may support a shift in how we delineate the political boundaries for legitimation processes, with respect to both the scope of the jurisdiction for the exercise of governance power, and the domain of the constituencies whose political support is warranted for governance institutions that meet prescribed legitimacy standards. On rationalist models of global legitimation, these political boundaries can be described as closed – capturing the sharply-defined jurisdictions and stable constituencies that are constituted through rationally-grounded rules, modelled on the institutional boundaries of nation-state or cosmopolitan orders. In contrast, creative legitimation supports a paradigm of open political boundaries, in which both the scope of governance powers, and the domain of legitimating constituencies, are open to ongoing contestation and change.With respect to the scope of governance powers, a commitment to creative legitimation pulls against the common idea that an institution’s legitimacy standards should be derived from its organizational charters or the aims of its founders. Instead, it demands openness of institutions to (both modest and more radical) transformations of their capabilities and functions, to keep up with the changing problem-definitions of their legitimating constituencies. With respect to the domain of these constituencies, it calls for broadening the legitimation processes of powerful state and non-state institutions to access and participation by a plurality of shifting stakeholders, beyond traditional local and national constituencies of statist governance.Second, reorienting the functional aims of political legitimation from rationalist to creative action may support a shift in how we understand and constitute legitimate global decision-making processes, within these more open boundaries. Familiar rationalist legitimation procedures are typically designed to harness collective rationalities through preference-aggregative or deliberative forms of social choice, which rely on structured procedures for decisive votes or formal agreements, of the kinds pursued through liberal international institutions. In contrast, creative legitimation aims at open-ended processes of social empowerment, involving more fluid and emergent collaborations – such as joint dialogues, policy experiments, or the sharing of information and technologies – which can produce valuable new commitments or capabilities for all parties even when faced with persistent disagreements about the best common course of political action.This diffusion of political decision-making processes out of formal international institutions is associated with a greater political role for non-state actors and networks in steering the outcomes of global political collaborations – including for-profit companies and value-chain networks, and not-for-profit organisations and social movements, operating across a plurality of local and transnational levels. And this calls in turn for more systematic re-consideration of the public status and responsibility of such non-state institutional actors – which go beyond established liberal agendas of ‘corporate social responsibility’ and ‘social accountability’, to support more substantive political models of social empowerment. Such models must place at their centre a recognition of material social and economic inequalities as an obstacle to social empowerment and legitimacy, and a corresponding commitment to tackling such inequalities as a precondition for successful politicalchallenges for legitimate global governanceThe promise of this new political ‘imaginary’ of global order and legitimacy is a pathway to restoring strong legitimacy to political institutions at all governance levels – from the local to the global. With this comes the prospect of stronger cooperation and collective problem-solving capacity, to direct towards the many complex and rapidly-evolving challenges – across domains of health, environment, security, economy, and beyond – that confront political communities in the 21st century.To translate this abstract vision into concrete political practices of creative legitimation, more work must be done to understand its potential complementarities and conflicts with the enduring ideals and practices of statist order and rationalist legitimation. In some political contexts, a commitment to creative legitimation aligns smoothly with familiar statist models of good governance and democracy – resonating strongly with recent pragmatist-inspired theoretical work on ideals of ‘open’ democracy, policy experimentalism or bricolage, and political entrepreneurship (Landemore, 2020). But in other contexts, there will be persistent tensions between the rationalist pressure to channel collective political action through structured public rules, and the creative imperative to bend, change, or circumvent such rigid structures. A central challenge for legitimation in the 21st century, accordingly, must be to re-think what remains of value in the 20th century’s imaginary of a ‘rules-based international order’, and what elements of this ideal may be due for revision.Alongside this challenge is the need to re-examine another central theme in 20th century debates on global legitimacy: the tension between ‘idealist’ and ‘realist’ approaches to institutional design and policy. Of particular importance here is the question of how creative legitimation can best understand and regulate the ‘dark side of creativity’ – that is, the established association of creative intelligences with dishonesty, transgression, and instability (Cropley et. al., 2010). To counteract such tendencies, the more ‘idealist’ theoretical treatments of creativity by older pragmatist and pluralist thinkers must be accompanied by the development of a more ‘realist’ analysis of the functional potentials and risks of creative legitimation – considering in particular what distinctive new accountability practices can work most effectively within the complex multi-stakeholder governance processes that will figure centrally in creative legitimation within a pluralist global order.This pluralist vision of creative legitimation sets a large and ambitious theoretical agenda for the emerging era of post-Westphalian global order. But like the growing global legitimacy crises to which this vision responds, it has been gestating for a century or more; and now its time has come to be politically born."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/09/01/opinion-reconsidering-indias-population-policy-through-a-regional-perspective/,Opinion – Reconsidering India’s ‘Population Policy’ through a Regional Perspective,Rudabeh Shahid,Sep 1 2021,"Over the summer, two states of India–Uttar Pradesh and Assam–have considered bills to what they proclaim as ways to encourage implementation of ‘decent family planning’. Some see this as ways to target the minority Muslim population of the country who are deemed to have a higher fertility rate in comparison to the nation’s Hindu majority population. This is not a minor issue as Uttar Pradesh is the country’s most populous province, and Assam is the nation’s gateway to the historically troubled north-eastern region.The most well-known country to have had a strict population policy was China. On 31 May of this year (2021), China announced that couples would now be allowed to have up to three children. Chinese Authorities cited that strict birth limits have created a ‘rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce’ that is straining the country’s economy. This can be taken as an admission that the consequences of the one-child norm (which was replaced with a two-child limit in 2016) were counterproductive. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to consider the nuances of this topic in India and also understand the broader regional perspective by considering cases that have been successful and which ones have not.Assam and Uttar Pradesh’s demographic fearsIn June, Assam’s Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that a particular “minority community” should adopt a ‘decent family planning policy’ for poverty reduction. In this context, I will quote what a politician from Assam once told me: ‘Muslims will demand Assam as a Muslim state. It is because Hindu families are giving birth to 1 or 2 children, and according to Hindu law over here, only one marriage is allowed. In Muslim communities, they can marry 9-10— as much as they want. Their birth rate is also much more than that of the Hindu community.This quote summarizes how certain politicians in Assam portray the higher birth rate within the Muslim community as being part of a larger plan to change the demography of the state.This singling out of a ‘community’ is very unfortunate, to say the least, given the fact that the increase in Muslim percentage has slowed down in Assam over the past couple of decades. In 2005-6, the fertility rate among the state’s Muslims was 3.6, but in 2019-20 it came down to 2.4. According to India’s National Family Health Survey of 2019-20, the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) in Assam is 1.9, which is lower than the ‘replacement rate’ of 2.1. So, is there really a need for such a policy that would prevent people with more than two children from securing government jobs or contesting municipal elections as proposed infollowing month, on July 11, Uttar Pradesh released a new draft bill outlining that couples with more than two children will be barred from applying for government jobs, seeking job promotions, and benefiting from government subsidies. While the state’s Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath did not mention any particular community when unveiling the bill, he did tell officials that the final version of the new population policy should be designed in a way to maintain “the demographic balance in all the communities”.It should be emphasised that overall in India, the TFR among Muslims in the southern states is much lower than the TFR among Hindus of three densely populated northern states: Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar. In fact, when examining each region of the country, it is also noticeable that fertility rates among Muslims are closer to their Hindu counterparts, along with other socioeconomic indicators.Genocidal tactics in MyanmarNow, if we consider India’s eastern neighbour, Myanmar, we find an alarming story. In 2005, a regulation was passed which restricted Rohingya Muslims to have two children. The implementation of the population controlling policy was consistent with broader laws geared towards the persecution of the largely stateless Rohingyas and violated international human rights protections.In a 2013 report, Human Rights Watch urged the Myanmar Government to withdraw this discriminatory population control regulation. Due to this law, Rohingya children in a family that already had two children became ineligible to receive any legal status, thereby making them ineligibleto acquire education and other government services. They were also unable to receive travel permissions, and in the future not being permitted to marry or acquire property. Human Rights Watch further said that this policy endangered women’s physical and mental health because to avoid paying fines or being arrested, Rohingya women who became pregnant after having two children were resorting to unsafe self-induced abortions.Human Rights Watch advised that contraceptive services and other reproductive and sexual health services should be provided in a non-discriminatory and non-coercive manner to all women in Myanmar.The successful case of BangladeshNow, moving on to another eastern neighbour of India, Bangladesh, we find that the implementation of non-discriminatory family planning measures being successful in reducing fertility. In 2000, the UN projected that Bangladesh’s population would soar to 265 million by 2050. The latest projections show the numbers are likely to climb to slightly more than 200 million by mid-century before stabilizing soon after.Since the country gained independence in 1971, both fertility and mortality rates declined drastically. According to the World Bank, in 1971, the total fertility rate was 6.94, which by 2019 reduced to 2.01. At the same time, life expectancy increased to around 73 years in 2018 from just 46 years in 1971. One reason for this accomplishment in improving socio-economic indicators is attributed to improved gender parity in school enrolment in the country, which has been achieved at both primary and secondary levels.In fact, with almost 6.4 million girls in secondary school in 2015, the country is among the few countries in the world where girls outnumber boys in secondary schools.Experts note that success in increasing education, employment opportunities and accessibility of contraceptives to women is primarily due to the local NGO sector. Over the years, NGOs have employed women field workers to provide family planning advice at people’s doorsteps and provided contraceptives. Trained female health workers from NGOs also make regular follow-up visits to help women adopt a method of contraception that was best for them, treat side-effects and provide basic maternal and child healthcare.A health organisation called International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh or ICDDR,B in short should be mentioned. ICDDR,B has one of the longest-running and most detailed health and population data sets in its Matlab hospital located in the south of the country. Through its field hospital, ICDDR,B demonstrated to women with little or no formal education how to plan their families, and this approach has spread throughoutsimple choice for policymakers in IndiaAfter considering examples of Myanmar and Bangladesh, it is noticeable that discriminatory and involuntary policies in the former case have not worked, while it has worked in the latter case where the policies were exactly opposite and not discriminatory. Considering the cases of Assam and Uttar Pradesh, it is also evident that the population policies in both these states are driven by ‘demographic fears’ stemming from Islamophobia. Yet, it should be quite apparent to Indian policymakers which example to emulate—non-discriminatory policies of Muslim-majority Bangladesh worked far better than the discriminatory policies implemented by the genocidal regime of Myanmar. The question is now whether Indian policy makers will still emphasise on singling out a particular community when formulating such policies? "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/31/afghanistans-liberal-history-back-to-year-zero/,Afghanistan’s ‘Liberal’ History: Back to Year Zero?,Martin Duffy,Aug 31 2021,"Among Afghan psephologists, a rare and currently highly endangered species, the country’s 1949 parliamentary elections are oftentimes regarded as a golden age of electoral freedom. Edwards (2002) explores this post-1949 period through the lives of three giants of Afghanistan’s history – Nur Muhammad Taraki, Samiullah Safi, and Qazi Amin Waqad. He shows how the promise of progress and prosperity that animated Afghanistan from the late 1940s, and again in the 1960s crumbled and became the present tragedy of discord, destruction, and despair (Ibid.) The political leaders whom Edwards profiles were engaged in the key struggles of the country’s recent history. They hoped to see Afghanistan become a more just and democratic nation. But their visions for their country were radically different, and in the end, all three failed and were killed or exiled. They have inspired a sense of liberal tolerance which occasionally still makes an appearance in the years after 1949. As the recent news from Afghanistan has been so bleak, it is interesting to reflect on an earlier, more liberal, Afghanistan which possessed strong female figures and dynamic student societies in a civil society accustomed to the concept of protest.In that year (1949) a confident political premier, Shah Mahmud permitted remarkably open polls to the country’s national assembly. Consequently, the parliamentary term which resulted under Mahmud (1949–1951) has historically been dubbed the “liberal parliament” (Barfield, 2012.) Barfield succinctly introduces readers to the diversity of tribal and ethnic groups in Afghanistan, explaining what unites them as Afghans despite the regional, cultural, and political differences that divide them. Barfield shows how Afghanistan’s armed factions plunged the country into a civil war, giving rise to clerical rule by the Taliban and Afghanistan’s isolation from the world. In many ways it is a tragic descent into chaos.Although neither a peacenik nor a political reformer, Mahmud was tolerant of press and opposition and there are some who look back fondly on his day. It was relatively short-lived. Alas, parliamentary elections in 1952 were considered a backward step. In the interim period the state had already lost its luster of liberalism, institutions had retreated into conservative fundamentalism, and liberalization had been stopped in its tracks. Student unions across the country were abruptly silenced, newspapers had become propagandistic and opposition leaders were mostly behind bars.Against such a repressive atmosphere, King Mohammed Zahir Shah approved a Loya jirga to be held in 1964. In Afghanistan, by tradition, such national meetings drew in the National Assembly, the Senate, and the Supreme Court and its commissions. The object was to create a new Afghan constitution. The King was not unduly worried about traitors as the entire assembly (consisting of 446 men and six women) actively supported him. However, the jirga did incorporate some dissidents among an assembly which eschewed a diversity of social, political, and religious opinion.Afghanistan’s 1965the time, the challenges of low voter turnout, lack of political parties, and efforts by government officials to influence the results went un-noticed in the atmosphere of this successful jirga. The parliament it created even boasted some anti-royalists, Pashtun nationalists, business folk, intellectual liberals, and lefties, although overwhelmingly and comfortably pro-royal. 1969 marked another one of Afghanistan’s retrospective steps backward. While more non-Pashtuns were elected than in the previous legislature, the urban liberals and female delegates were decimated. This was a high-water mark that political and civil society tolerance in a future Afghanistan was a quality always under threat.Whether as a republic or democratic republic things smoldered on as they were until in 1987, the Soviet-backed Afghan communist government introduced a law permitting the formation of other political parties. It also announced that it would share power with opposition groups and welcomed a new bicameral National Assembly (Meli Shura), with a president to be indirectly elected to a seven year term. In November 1987, a Loya jirga unanimously elected Najibullah as President. Evidence of the future political rift was already manifest. The 1988 elections were ominously boycotted by the Mujahideen. Nevertheless, the Afghan government left a guaranteed 50 of the 234 seats in the House of Representatives, and further seats in the Senate, vacant in the hope that the guerrillas would participate (Ibid.) They failed to do so- an ominous foreboding of the lack of inclusiveness which has characterized Afghanistan ever since.Creation of the Islamic Republic of AfghanistanWith the withdrawal of Soviet troops and demise of communist government in April 1992, an indirect election for president was held in December 1992 ushering in the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. The foremost study of this period carefully explains how the Taliban came into being, how it is sustained underground terrorism and how Osama bin Laden had risen to such a figure of absolute power (Rashid, 2001.) Rashid clarifies the often confusing racial and religious tensions that dominate this fractious land and how the drug trade exacerbates an already strained situation.Under the 2001 Bonn Agreement, Afghanistan should have held presidential and parliamentary elections in 2004 in lieu of the transitional assembly of American-backed Hamid Karzai (Venning, 2020). Presidential elections were held in 2004, but parliamentary elections were not held until mid-September 2005. Karzai won the election with 55.4% of the votes and three times more votes than any other candidate. That was straightforward enough. However, and predictably, trouble flared with the provincials and parliamentary polls. Afghanistan held parliamentary and provincial council elections on September 18, 2005. The release of official results was delayed by accusations of election fraud, and were finally announced on November 12, 2005. These results were much more problematic.Former warlords secured most seats in both the lower house and the provincial council. Women won 28% of the seats in the lower house, six more than the 25% guaranteed under the 2004 Constitution. Even by then, psephologists were expressing doubt about the diligence of the Afghan electoral roll. The August 2009 presidential and provincial council elections were stymied by violence, fraud, and intimidation. Over a million votes had to be excluded on grounds of suspected fraud in an electoral exercise borne by the long-suffering international community at a cost of up to $500 million. The UN put voter turnout at around 30%. Under US pressure, Karzai agreed to a run-off vote between himself and his main rival, Dr Abdullah Abdulla. The Afghan election commission and Karzai were lobbied from the United States and its allies to cancel the run-off. They complied and it neverElectionsAfghanistan’s next parliamentary elections were held on September 18, 2010. More than 2,600 candidates, including more than 400 women, ran for office. This looked encouraging, at least on the surface. However, the Taliban proved to be active election spoilers. During the run-up to the elections in September 2010, the Taliban intimidated villagers from voting. In such areas, many people would not vote because the Taliban left night letters warning they will cut off the finger of anyone if they find it marked with the indelible ink used to prevent multiple voting. In late November 2010, Afghanistan’s election commission disqualified 21 candidates from the September 18 parliamentary elections for alleged fraudulent activities, a spokesperson said. 19 of the candidates were winning or leading their races, according to partial election results, while two others had failed to win seats (Venning, 2020).A presidential election was held in Afghanistan on 5 April 2014. Incumbent president Hamid Karzai was not eligible to run due to term limits. An initial field of 27 candidates was whittled down to 8. The frontrunners were the veteran politician Abdullah Abdullah and former World Bank official, Ashraf Ghani. Fraud allegations tainting the final result resulted in a recount of votes at 1,900 of the 23,000 polling stations Ghani was eventually declared the winner in September 2014.Parliamentary elections were held on 20 October 2018 to elect members of the House of the People. They had originally been scheduled for 15 October 2016, but were postponed to 20 October 2018. Much of the prelude to the elections focused on the debate over reforming the country’s electoral laws. The new parliament was later inaugurated on April 26, 2019. Once again, Afghanistan took two steps forward and two steps back – a familiar scene in the story of modern Afghanistan.Democracy Derailed or Walking DeadMalala Yousafzai described the impact of extremism and the rise of the Taliban on her native Pakistan (Yousafzai, 2013.) This autobiography details the early life of Yousafzai, her father’s ownership of schools and activism, the rise and fall of the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in Swat Valley and the assassination attempt made against Yousafzai, when she was aged 15, following her activism in support of female education. Afghanistan has now been a unique international preoccupation for more than twenty years. During that time Afghanistan has seen powerful personalities and occasionally genuine efforts to build democracy.While not without accusations of intimidation and vote-rigging, modern Afghanistan has consistently conducted elections of some variety and with greater or lesser approval rating. Year zero has (however) been reached in the events of August 2021 by the arrival of a nomenclature of government yet unmatched by any of those precedents even all the way back to Shah Mahmud in 1949. The streets of Kabul are eerily quiet at night as this once vibrant city is visited by an invasion of outward and aggressive religiosity. Afghanistan hunkers down, fearful of the days ahead. Women house-bound, anyone with international connections nervous, and most fearful of the future.Approaching Year ZeroIt is almost a dystopian vision to wake up surrounded by an administration who required no democratic election and yet hold virtually the country’s entire geographical territory. As those expensive American Humvees are sequestered by the Taliban to pursue Afghanistan’s infamous ghost soldiers, one might be forgiven for skepticism as to the fortune reaped by such a colossal investment in money, life, politics, and spirit. To Afghanistan’s ghost wars, we add its ghost soldiers who may well explain why resistance to the Taliban proved so limp (Venning, 2020) However we should not belittle the enormous sacrifice made by the international community and by Afghanistan to cultivate an indigenous democracy. Perhaps the terrain proved just too unviable for democratic elections to bethe Taliban consolidate hands-on governance and the international evacuation effort ends, there is little prospect of future work for Afghanistan’s psephologists. The aspiring words of global leaders and UN administrators could not hold the strategic progress which had been achieved. The international community sleeps uneasily contemplating the political future of this contested country. For Americans there is an inevitable “Saigon syndrome”, for Britons re-lived horrors of the 1842 retreat from Kabul, and for NATO, a sense of a world imperfect.There is palpable uncertainty about the months ahead, and what horror may yet face the people of Afghanistan. International eyes will be on the diplomatic and strategic red lines which evolve as nations engage with the emergent Taliban administration and its promissory statement on rights. As we do so, we should not forget these ill-fated people have endured a diversity of leaders amidst a rich modern history. There is some inspiration for us in the great Afghan tradition of proverbs. In a prominent acclamation we are encouraged to, “forget the past, but look out in the future”, thus reminding us of the cyclicality of a tragic history. With great resonance for the present, Afghans also say, “blood cannot be washed out with blood.”"

Dirk Moses,Aug 27 2021,"Image by Howard Rechavia-TaylorGermany’s long-repressed colonial past has finally come to preoccupy its international relations and domestic affairs. Whether in the controversies about the often-dubiously acquired artefacts in its museums (Raubkunst), like the so-called Benin Bronzes (which are not all bronze), or attention to the genocides committed by Imperial German forces in African colonies before the First World War, German federal authorities and institutions are confronting colonial legacies that they have long denied. Sustained advocacy has much to do with the newfound and charged diplomatic significance of these issues. Within Germany activists of colour, in particular, have pressured the orthodoxies of German memory culture by protesting to change street names, to decolonize German museums, and for Germany to pay reparations for the Herero and Nama genocide – to name three significant issues. This activism extends beyond Germany, to former colonies such as Cameroon and Tanzania but especially to Namibia. The stakes of these debates are profound in a country where the idea of the singularity of the Holocaust and Israel’s security has become a form of Staatsräson and, relatedly, where Holocaust reparations and atonement for the Holocaust have become central to German identity in the postwar order.In a process that we can broadly say has become part of national politics since reunification- the German state has dedicated itself to reckoning with a dark past- the legacy of the Nazi regime, especially the Holocaust.This process is known in German as Vergangenheitsbewältigung, roughly translated as ‘coming to terms’, ‘working through’, or ‘mastering the past’. Because this process has been underway since the 1950s in one way or another, and because of the Holocaust’s newfound status as the foundational crime of the post-1945 world,actors involved in the recent colonial era-related cases very often compare them in some way to the template provided by Germany’s approach to dealing with its Nazi past. The horizon of possibility of issues and campaigns around colonialism in Germany is often this previous – and ongoing – reckoning.Of course, the easily made distinction between German colonialism and National Socialism presumes that the Nazi regime was not also engaged in a form of colonialism – namely of European nation-states – whose resources and populations it ruthlessly exploited and murdered, and whose artistic treasures it plundered in establishing a continental empire.Making this observation about Nazi colonialism and empire has long been common among contemporaries and non-German historians, but it remains controversial in Germany. Many scholars, journalists, and activists there react allergically to linking the Nazi Reich and the Holocaust to colonialism. The latter was not ‘just’ a ‘colonial crime’, they insist, but something more profound, a fundamental ‘civilizational rupture’ that forms the basis of Western morality. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental organization founded in 1998 ‘to strengthen, advance and promote Holocaust education, research and remembrance’, expresses this viewpoint. It is committed to the Stockholm Declaration for 2000, which posits that ‘The Holocaust (Shoah) fundamentally challenged the foundations of civilization. The unprecedented character of the Holocaust will always hold universal meaning’. Further, ‘The magnitude of the Holocaust, planned and carried out by the Nazis, must be forever seared in our collective memory’. Government ministers do not utter such statements about the colonial crimes committed in the past by the states they serve. After all, that violence was perpetrated in the name of Western civilization as understood by contemporaries.However much German Government officials, journalists, and academics disavow those crimes now, their reluctance to link them to the Nazi empire and its crimes betrays their view of colonialism as essentially a benign affair with some occasional if regrettable excesses. One German historian, Götz Aly, laid bare the common view in distinguishing the Holocaust from colonial genocides by saying that the latter were provoked by uprisings and were thus reactively defensive (Gegenwehr), while the Holocaust was purely the ideologically-driven killing of Jews simply because they were Jews. Moreover, so the argument continues, because the perpetration of the Holocaust directed resources away from the Nazi military campaign, it was counter-rational and thus represented a ‘civilizational rupture’ unlike previous episodes of mass violence. This distinction is the basis of the German commitment to the Holocaust’s singularity (Einzigartigkeit) that constitutes what one of the authors calls the ‘German catechism’: a set of propositions about official memory culture with diplomaticis against this horizon of a national commitment to the singularity of the Shoah that actors fighting for historical justice within Germany continuously have to reckon. This struggle is not confined to Germany. Activists, diplomats, and other actors outside of Germany often need to accept a number of its terms in order to be eligible to receive forms of recognition from the German state. This is the case for those whose ancestors were once German subjects: those who are searching for justice in histories of German imperialism, racial science, plunder, and dispossession. It also affects Palestinians and the Palestinian cause – insofar as critique of the State of Israel is understood to be a critique of the moral foundations of the postwar order itself. It is in these spaces and places that the transnational element of the German-Holocaust template appears and that the question of international relations becomes of importance. If only the Holocaust is seen as a civilizational rupture, what does that mean when activists demand redress?The question of reparations hangs ominously over these debates. The term is often invoked but rarely fully understood, and yet the stakes of its usage are clear: who is entitled to reparations and who is not, how is that entitlement or lack thereof configured by the German state, what do reparations for genocide and colonisation look like and how might they be administered? If reparations are to any degree monetary, then how does German officialdom – lawyers, diplomats, and politicians, for example – engage with the question of to whom a debt is to be owed and how is that debt understood and articulated, if at all?At its height, at the outbreak of the First World War, Germany was one of the largest colonial empires in the world. Its effects upon the African continent remain accordingly salient to contemporary African politics. The Herero and Nama genocide, for example, has an afterlife that continues to affect contemporary Namibian lives, livelihoods, and lands as well as anti-Blackness in Germany itself. As Namibian activists, especially Herero, Nama, and San activists, have been pointing out for some time, they continue to reckon with ongoing white, often German, ownership of their land. They are predominantly landless peoples as a result of German colonialism and genocide, and have been consistently discriminated against up until the present day. They continue to fight for the return of human remains often stolen for the purposes of racial science in institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History. It is their struggle for recognition and redress from the German state that has become one of the most central to contemporary discussions around German colonialism as it pertains to international relations.For observers unfamiliar with what has been taking place in recent years at the international level it can appear dizzyingly complex. Numerous observers have announced that Germany has now offered reparations for colonialism in Namibia and the Herero and Nama genocide- though this is not strictly true. While this moment is certainly not insignificant, it is more of a rethinking of the role of development aid in international relations than the kind of payments to so-called ‘victim communities’ that are conventionally part of reparations programmes.While the former – the rethinking of development aid – has taken place, the latter certainly has not. It is true that reparations in this case would require a fundamental rethinking of human rights vernaculars of what it means to be a “victim”- given the intergenerational nature of dispossession over more than a century.Yet no matter how fraught the concept of the genocide victim may be in this case- there are clear intergenerational stakes for Herero, Nama, and San people that there is not for the Namibian state- and that development aid cannotcan speak, then, of two interrelated but distinct transnational processes at this moment. The first process entailed a long series of interstate negotiations between the German and Namibian governments involving numerous meetings between diplomats in both Berlin and Windhoek. The negotiations lasted between 2015 and 2020, and concluded with their signing in May of this year. The ensuing agreement commits US$ 1.3 billion in development aid to Namibia over a 30-year period for a set of development projects and a national reconciliation initiative, and it has been widely reported in the news media. Germany also announced that it will describe the mass murder and racial dispossession using the term genocide and the Namibian state has declared that it will accept Germany’s apology- over the heads of the activists who have been fighting for this cause for decades.What is an apology without the consent of those who are to be apologised to?The second is a process of litigation from non-state actors, namely diasporic and local Herero and Nama organisations such as the Association of the Ovaherero Genocide in the USA and the late Paramount Chief of the Ovaherero people Vekuii Rukoro. Together they sued Germany in a New York court partly in response to their clear exclusion from those above-mentioned negotiations. Their case was lost after various appeals, and they continued to be excluded from bilateral negotiations up until the signing of the agreement itself. Germany will apologise without the consent of the majority of the descendants of those it murdered and dispossessed. Moreover, the money offered will not be figured as reparation for the crime of genocide, and it will go through the Namibian state itself, which is accused by many sides of instrumentalizing the ‘genocide cause’ for their own coffers.In Howie Rechavia-Taylor’s ethnographic research that touches upon these ongoing processes and the diplomatic consequences of a supposed new Vergangenheitsbewältigung, it became clear that the struggle for colonial reparation has produced a crisis of representation, one that has precipitated (white) German racial anxiety about the alleged ‘lack of unity’ amongst Namibians. The diversity of opinion, of community organisation, of kinds of demand from Namibia has been replaced by a singular focus on the Namibian Government. The struggle for many Herero, Nama, and San activists has precisely been one that would allow them to represent themselves in their diversity toGerman officials beyond the state. They have been systematically disappeared. The Namibian state has been favoured, which has itself taken part in a process of exclusion – remaining the preserve of an ethnic majority largely uninterested in engaging with the legacies of dispossession beyond the Apartheid era. Key here, too, is the fact that Herero and Nama people are not all, or not solely, citizens of the Namibian state. Genocide in the broadest sense of the term often creates diaspora – and bilateral negotiations are incapable of accounting for exile.There is then a struggle for descendants of a colonial genocide to represent themselves. They persistently point to the fact that the Jewish diaspora, representing various organizations and communities, were allowed to represent themselves on their terms in the wake of the Shoah, namely through the Jewish Claims Conference (JCC). The JCC is a non-state actor that continues to represent many Holocaust survivors and claims for reparation and restitution to this day. Why is it so hard for Germany to afford the possibility of representation to Namibians of diverse communities – beyond the Namibian state – if they can do so for Jews of diverse communities beyond the ‘Jewish’ state, Israel? While the Jewish Claims Conference can certainly not be said to have represented the entirety of the Jewish diaspora- nor the entirety of the Holocaust surviving community- it was still an organization beyond the state that could negotiate with the German government for a reparations agreement. The Herero and Nama genocide and its aftermath are by no means identical to the Holocaust and its aftermath, but that does not rule out comparisons about the seriousness with which the question of reparations has been dealt.A lot of the reticence of the German state to engage with representatives beyond the Namibian state has to do with arguments around temporality, statutes of limitations, and the question of the retroactivity of the genocide convention. It is crucially, too, however, about the rejection of the very concept of ‘reparation’ itself, a notion that the German state has steadfastly refused to utilise, including in the context of negotiations with the Namibian state itself. The German argument is that it has a moral and historical responsibility to Namibia, but not a legal responsibility. The term ‘reparation’, it is argued, must remain specific to the ‘Rechtsfragen’ (legal questions) that emerged in the aftermath of the Holocaust. German negotiators prefer the term ‘healing the wound’ (die Wunde heilen) toidea, however, that reparations are solely a ‘Rechtsfrage’ is itself a misnomer, including in the context of the aftermath of the Holocaust. There is no association between the Nuremberg Trials and reparations payments to Holocaust survivors, as is often assumed. In the first instance, these were political, not legal, processes that involved international Jewish activism beyond Nuremberg and German state response.Political negotiations ensued between Germany, the State of Israel and the JCC. There was German political agency and German political will. This is true too in the moment of the 1990s when slave labour cases took place in New York courts. Cases were settled outside of court. While the law may have been the ‘way in’, it was not primarily due to criminal or tort liability that Germany has engaged in reparatory justice after the Holocaust.What is clear is that there has been a willingness to say the ‘R’ word in the context of the Holocaust on the part of German diplomats which has been almost completely absent in the context of Namibia and the Herero and Nama genocide – whatever form those reparations may take – and they certainly cannot only be monetary in a context where dispossession continues. There has been a recoding of bilateral development aid as ‘wound healing’, but not a focus on the specific peoples and lands that were targeted by genocide.What we are pointing to here, then, is the idea of the singularity of Holocaust reparations, which itself derives from the supposed singularity of the Holocaust. This posits that there is only one case in which diverse members of a community can be engaged with to offer forms of restitution and to ensure representativeness – and that is the case of the Shoah. The fact that even the term ‘reparation’ for German diplomats is sutured to the Jewish people writ large is part and parcel of that issue. Whether or not Holocaust reparations are a useful template, the bilateral manner in which the process of postcolonial coming to terms with past (what could be described as a Postkoloniale Vergangenheitsbewältigung)has taken place continues to demote non-Jewish legacies of dispossession and murder – here in relation to diasporic and continental Africans, their histories, and their lifeworlds – at the hands of the German state. The question that the German – and European – political class needs to answer to the satisfaction of their former colonial subjects making claims upon them today is this: can its ideology of ‘civilizational rupture’ as Germany and Europe’s moral foundation include the diversity of peoples who have been affected by the genocides and other forms of political violence committed in Africa? Need the centralization of the Holocaust – which Germans and Europeans naturally need to commemorate appropriately – exclude them? "

The humanitarian tragedy that unfolded has been widely documented on international media, with desperate Afghans fleeing for their lives from advancing Taliban forces, alongside an outpouring of global sympathy to the beleaguered Afghan people. Arguably, this humanitarian crisis was the culmination of the smart application of protracted and irregular warfare strategy and tactics, wherein the technologically inferior Taliban outlasted the political will of far superior Western forces. Eventually, the Taliban mounted a campaign of rapid dominance, which saw the embryonic Afghan military put up a token resistance before surrendering or fleeing in droves to neighboring countries.Afghanistan has been marked by sporadic conflict and chronic instability since the 1979 Soviet-Afghan War. However, its strategic location and substantial natural resources have always been a contested area for regional and international players. As the conflict has reached this decisive phase, it has profound implications for all regional and international parties involved. What can be said in the aftermath is that there is no clear winner but one clear loser.US: Finding a Silver LiningFor many, the Fall of Kabul is a US defeat comparable to the Fall of Saigon. Scenes of US helicopters and aircraft being swarmed by desperate Afghan civilians in a last-ditch effort to escape the Taliban were juxtaposed with pictures of South Vietnamese civilians crowding US helicopters and aircraft in a desperate bid to escape Communist rule.Despite being portrayed as a US defeat, the US still managed to win in some areas of the Afghan Civil War. First, the US still maintains its superpower status. Unlike the Soviet-Afghan War, which was instrumental in bringing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the US defeat in Afghanistan barely affects the US’ global political, military, economic, and cultural preponderance. Second, the long-overdue US withdrawal from Afghanistan can be seen as part of a larger US military drawdown in the Middle East to reorient its strategic attention and free up resources for the Indo-Pacific. Third, the US may have indirectly created a stay-behind force in the Taliban. Similar to NATO’s organized stay-behind forces intended to continue guerilla resistance against the Soviet Union, the Taliban will continue to be a security concern for Russia, China, and Iran, posing a threat to those US adversaries’ most vulnerable borders withafter withdrawing its forces from Afghanistan and allowing the Taliban to take over the country, the US lost a strategic foothold in Central Asia. US combat aircraft based in Afghanistan could quickly strike at weakly defended military targets in Russia, China, and Iran. Further, the US also lost access to Afghanistan’s substantial rare earth metals and lithium reserves, deemed strategic resources for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Moreover, the US also lost control of the Afghan opium trade, which may have served as a covert source of income and could be weaponized against US adversaries such as Russia, China, and Iran, fueling corruption, crime, and the HIV pandemic in those countries.The US withdrawal from Afghanistan is undoubtedly the most controversial decision taken by the Biden Administration, although the preceding Trump Administration touched off the process. This unpopular decision comes when the US grapples with intensifying internal political, racial, social, and economic divisions. US veterans of the Afghan Civil War, along with other sectors of civil society, can become vociferous critics of US domestic and foreign policy, eventually sapping US political and public will for future military interventions, thereby diminishing US credibility for its allies in the Middle East and Indo-Pacific. If anything, the Fall of Kabul and Fall of Saigon have demonstrated that the US can abandon allies at will if it so wishes. In military terms, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan showed that the US is vulnerable against adversaries employing asymmetric warfare strategies and tactics. With a far superior military, the US has lost against a much lesser equipped irregular force like the Taliban. Its military capability versus adversaries who employ hybrid warfare strategies combining asymmetric and conventional warfighting features is now questioned.China: Opportunity in CrisisChina has long been a critic of US presence in Afghanistan, as Afghanistan has a shared border with China, and that the US and China are competing for global dominance. Afghanistan may have been just another front in the US containment strategy to encircle China with military bases, as it did with the Soviet Union. That said, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan has created opportunities but also opened security challenges for China.First, the US withdrawal has removed a credible threat next to China’s borders, as US combat aircraft based in Afghanistan can be used to strike at China’s sparsely populated and lightly defended Xinjiang region. Second, China can use this opportunity to flex its diplomatic and political muscles in recognizing the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan. This can be seen as an attempt to overturn the West’s monopoly in defining state legitimacy. China can use this opportunity to break this Western monopoly as part of its efforts to create a China-centric international system.Third, the US withdrawal enables China to access Afghanistan’s strategic resources such as rare earth metals and lithium to fuel its rapidly growing economy. Now the second-largest economy, China can potentially overtake the US economy in the coming years. In connection with this, China can integrate Afghanistan as the hub in its Belt and Road geopolitical project, connecting Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan to China. Fourth, with the US out of Afghanistan, China can control Afghanistan’s opium trade and weaponize it against the US, adding to the financial and social costs of the growing US opioid epidemic.However, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan also poses security risks to China. First, the Taliban can support the East Turkestan Independence Movement (ETIM) based in Xinjiang. The ETIM and Taliban have close ideological and cultural ties, and the Taliban has allegedly provided sanctuary for ETIM fighters. While China and the Taliban may have agreed that the latter would withdraw support from the ETIM in exchange for political support and economic assistance, it remains to be seen if the Taliban will keep their word. In addition, Afghanistan under the Taliban can be used as a sanctuary for terrorists plotting attacks on China’s Belt and Road projects in Central Asia andReconsolidating InfluenceSimilar to China, Russia benefits from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in the sense that a credible threat near its lightly defended frontier adjacent to Central Asia has been neutralized. US combat aircraft based in Afghanistan can attack Russian forces stationed in Central Asian countries and parts of Russia adjacent to the region. Admittedly, the Taliban accomplished what Russia could not during the Soviet-Afghan War, which prevented the US from gaining a foothold in Central Asia, threatening Russia’s vulnerable areas. Further, the Taliban victory gives Russia a reason to strengthen its military cooperation with Central Asian countries. This will prevent instability in Afghanistan from spilling over into Russia and adjacent countries, and it will counterbalance China’s growing influence in Central Asia as the region is perceived to be well within Russia’s traditional sphere of influence.However, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan has also created a possible haven for radical terrorists in Russia. Afghanistan has allegedly been used as a training ground for Chechen rebels fighting in the Caucasus. There have been reports that some of the fiercest resistance to US forces in Afghanistan came from Chechen fighters. In addition, Russia remains a top destination of Afghan opium. As opium revenues make up much of the Taliban’s income, Russia can expect an upsurge in drug proliferation in its territories as the Taliban attempts to increase opium production and produce synthetic drugs to earn funding for their domestic agenda in Afghanistan.Pakistan: Keeping the Pot BoilingIn terms of security and economic value, Afghanistan is critical to Pakistan’s core national interests. Pakistan has allegedly supported the Taliban since its formation during the Soviet-Afghan War. Despite the strategic importance of Afghanistan to Pakistan, a stable Afghanistan does not work in Pakistan’s favor.First, Afghanistan’s instability and resulting lack of economic activities make it a captured market for Pakistan. Afghanistan has become a dumping ground for cheap Pakistani products, which, alongside chronic instability, has hindered Afghan industries’ growth while providing a steady profit for Pakistan. Second, Afghanistan’s lack of functioning state institutions and substantial ungoverned spaces make it an ideal sanctuary and training ground for Pakistani-sponsored anti-India terrorist groups. Third, Afghanistan provides Pakistan strategic depth in case of an all-out conflict with India. Afghanistan’s rugged and mountainous terrain makes it an ideal defensive position for Pakistani forces to regroup and hold out against numerically and technologically superior Indian forces.However, a stable Afghanistan under Taliban rule opens the former to sponsor the Pashtun separatist movement in Pakistan’s territory. The Taliban is a predominantly Pashto organization, and Pashtun nationalism is one of the critical components of the Taliban’s ideology. Further, Afghanistan was the only country to vote against the creation of Pakistan in the United Nations in 1947. This was because the creation of Pakistan would divide the Pashto people between Afghan-Pakistani borders. Further, the Pashtun population in Pakistan lives in one of the country’s poorest and underserved locations and thus has many reasons to resent living under Pakistani rule. A Baloch separatist movement in Pakistan backed by the Taliban in Afghanistan can pose a significant threat to Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security.India: Playing a Bad HandThe Taliban takeover of Afghanistan is a huge strategic loss for India. In the coming years, India may find itself at a disadvantage in its rivalry between Pakistan and China, with Afghanistan’s strategic space being exploited by the latter against the former. Despite that, India may still find a silver lining in this course of events.The Fall of Kabul cemented the Taliban as the top authority in Afghanistan. That said, India could dwell on the possibility of a Taliban-sponsored Baloch separatist movement in Pakistan to squeeze the latter from the north, simultaneously applying military pressure from the south in Jammu and Kashmir. However, this remote possibility depends on the emergence of a stable Afghanistan under Taliban rule, combined with the continued poverty and mismanagement of Pakistan’s Tribal Areas. India can play on the fact that even if, at present, it does not have the means to influence events in Afghanistan directly, the Taliban will want recognition and financial ties with India to counterbalance Pakistani influence to remain independent from external influence.that marginal and remote possibility may be primarily offset by India’s losses in Afghanistan. One of India’s main interests in Afghanistan focuses on turning it into a hub of regional connectivity. Additionally, India views Afghanistan as an essential component of its plans to access Central Asian markets, energy, and resources, as India’s only path to Central Asia goes through Afghanistan. Afghanistan played a crucial role in the US-sponsored New Silk Road project, which aims to connect Central Asia and South Asia through Afghanistan via trade, transit, and power routes. With Afghanistan falling under Taliban rule once more, India may have lost its only overland access to Central Asian resources, energy, and markets, as India’s only path to the region crosses through Afghanistan. Further, as China makes headway in recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government, the focus of Afghanistan as a critical hub of regional connectivity may fall into the China-sponsored Belt and Road Initiative.These developments can also affect India’s capability to participate in the Quad Alliance in the Indo-Pacific region. India might find itself dealing with more immediate land-based threats from a Pakistan-Taliban-China nexus on its land borders.Iran: Two Sides of the CoinSame with Russia and China, the US withdrawal from Afghanistan removes a significant threat to Iran, as US combat aircraft based in Afghanistan could be used to attack Iran. It can be recalled that the US RQ-170 drone captured by Iran in 2011 was flown from Kandahar in Afghanistan.Although Iran almost invaded Afghanistan in 1998 after the Taliban murdered its diplomats and was said to have covertly assisted the US to overthrow it in 2001, Iran is confident that the Taliban will be more moderate and open to negotiations this time. Further, Iran may have already been reassured of the Taliban’s intentions, as before the Fall of Kabul, Iran and the Taliban were in negotiations about the security situation in Afghanistan.There are two different views about the Taliban in Iran. The first view is that a Taliban government in Afghanistan is inevitable, and Iran must accept this reality to manage mutual tensions. This view is popular with the conservative and hardline Iranian defense and security sector. They believe that the Taliban is a better alternative to a Western-backed proxy government in Afghanistan. The second view, which is popular among political moderates in Iran, holds that while it is necessary to recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government, Afghanistan will still become a space for terrorist groups hostile to Iran.The common denominator between these two views is that Iran must recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government. However, these views differ markedly on their prognosis of the Taliban. Nevertheless, both conservative and moderate political factions in Iran believe that recognizing the Taliban is necessary to address more immediate security challenges, such as terrorism, the flow of refugees, and the opium problem from Afghanistan.Taliban: Still Much to be DoneWhile the Taliban is savoring their victory in Afghanistan and is working swiftly to consolidate their control over the country, they still face significant internal and external challenges. First, the Taliban need to maintain their internal cohesion and integrity. Although the Taliban is a Pashto-dominated organization, much of their recent success can be attributed to the successful co-opting of other ethnicities in Afghanistan, such as Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmen, and Hazaras. It remains to be seen whether the Taliban will disintegrate due to internal infighting between ethnic, tribal, and personal loyalties or maintain the cohesion necessary to function as a state governing body.Second, the Taliban face the colossal task of rebuilding Afghanistan’s shattered economy and state institutions to win domestic legitimacy. The dysfunction of Afghan government institutions and the security sector enabled the Taliban to win local legitimacy in many of Afghanistan’s poorer rural areas. It would be ironic if the Taliban’s incompetence and brutality in governance resulted in mass resistance against their rule. Further, organizations that have seized state power through force of arms and not through political processes such as elections have often striven to win domestic legitimacy through stable but not necessarily strong economic performance that benefits key stakeholders and intolerance of political opposition.Third, the Taliban still face the challenge of winning international recognition as a legitimate government. In the past, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have ever given some form of recognition to the Taliban. No country wants to be the first to recognize the Taliban as a legitimate government of Afghanistan officially. That said, the Taliban still needs to have wider international recognition so, at the very least, it can attract funding and foreign investment to bring in much-needed revenue. China and Iran seem to be edging closer to extending formal recognition to the Taliban based on their pragmatic interests inAn Uncertain FutureUnder the Taliban, Afghanistan can evolve in one of three possible directions. First, Afghanistan can become a hermit state like North Korea, a self-contained unstable state living in relative autarky. Afghanistan has always been a remote, unstable country throughout its history, and preceding Afghan governments never had complete control. However, due to Afghanistan’s strategic location and resources, external powers will unlikely leave a Taliban-controlled Afghanistan alone.Second, the Taliban might win limited international recognition for its stakeholders, such as Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and UAE, with Russia, China, and Iran in the future. This scenario is dependent on the Taliban’s capacity to maintain cohesion and resisting breaking apart into smaller factions from different regional and external powers vying for foreign patronage.A third but extremely remote possibility is for the Taliban to be fully recognized as a legitimate government by the international community at large, but not by all states. In some ways, the Taliban functions like a secret society in the sense that it offers benefits to a tightly controlled inner circle while shunning all outside interactions. However, secret societies can become mainstream organizations when they begin to provide net benefits to general society. Likewise, if the Taliban can turn things around by playing wisely on Afghanistan’s strategic importance, they may be eventually recognized as a legitimate government in the long run. After all, there are no clear-cut rules on how states are formed and legitimized.Conclusion: One Clear LoserThe Afghanistan conflict has provided the necessary dynamics of instability and lacks institutions making it an inviting strategic space for competing regional and international parties. As the conflict has reached a decisive point in the Fall of Kabul, major parties must reevaluate their position relative to the new circumstances in Afghanistan. While the conflict is now widely portrayed as a defeat for the US and its allies and as a victory for the Taliban and its supporters, victory or defeat is not a black-and-white matter. The winners of the Afghan Civil War may find themselves embroiled in issues that were not apparent at the time of their victory, while the defeated parties can still look forward to playing the long game.Nevertheless, one thing is certain. The brunt of the material and human costs of the Afghan Civil War were paid by the Afghan people, with their country facing an uncertain future under Taliban rule, having sacrificed innumerable lives, and suffered unspeakable horrors under decades of foreign domination and infighting. As the Taliban tightens their grip over Afghanistan, emboldened by their string of victories and empowered by powerful foreign patrons, perhaps the humane thing to do is understand that not all in Afghanistan can be saved, but in what can be saved lies the future of the Afghan nation.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/24/what-does-our-recent-past-tell-us-about-the-future-of-peruvian-democracy/,What Does Our Recent Past Tell Us About the Future of Peruvian Democracy?,Italo Beltrão Sposito,Aug 24 2021,"Presidencia Perú/FlickrOn July 19th, Castillo was declared the winner of the Peruvian 2021 general elections by the National Election Jury, the body responsible for the country’s electoral process. It had turbulent electoral aftermath during which his opponent Keiko Fujimori used the already established strategy of far-right candidates by contesting electoral results. Despite finally recognizing her defeat, Fujimori’s political history and style show that she will use aggressive tactics to hamper Castillo’s conditions to govern. Castillo will face restraints to govern from different sides. First, the opposition will control the Congress, as María del Carmen Alva, from Acción Popular, was elected its president with the support of Fujimori’s Fuerza Popular. Despite a tradition of the presidential party to head the Legislative branch, Perú Libre did not form a winning coalition because of internal division and a fragmented congress. The main obstacle was probably Castillo’s electoral promise to rewrite the constitution through a Constitutional Assembly, which does not have congressional support, that fears a dissolution.There are concerns regarding Castillo’s first steps as the incumbent and how other political actors are answering. He nominated Guido Bellido as prime minister and chief of his Cabinet, a congressman from the more radical faction of Perú Libre. The mainstream media immediately aligned itself with the right. Also, the military has refused to symbolically recognize Castillo as commander-in-chief until he names the new chief of the Armed Forces. Additionally, his popular mandate (and therefore popularity) depends on pushing reforms to please his supporters from Peruvian rural areas. Such reforms should dissatisfy the elite of Lima, which likely will react negatively to his plans to nationalize the strategic sector. Finally, he is close to the Shining Path and has alleged that intends to reform the constitutions.Despite all these legitimate concerns, throughout this text, I will argue that instead of centering on the presidential behavior, his social and political background, we need to have in mind that the recent political instability in Peru is a systemic problem. To put forward my argument, first, I review studies on presidential breakdowns and democratic erosion, especially the one engaged in explaining Latin American multiparty presidential systems instability. Second, I use those lenses to analyze Castillo’s first steps in office and present prospects for Peruvian democracy. I conclude with some brief comments.How Can the Lens of Comparative Politics Help Us?The first consideration to be made is that a coup is virtually impossible, both as Castillo does not have support from the military and regime collapse by coups are now rare. Since the beginning of the third wave of democratization (started at the end of the 1970s), presidential breakdowns (the interruption of presidencies without a regime collapse) substituted coups. They are common in Latin America, especially in South America (Hochstetler and Edwards 2009). Broadly, they have an equivalent principal function to coups as both aim to get rid of unwanted presidents. Causally, bad economic performance, broad protests, and political actors’ radicalization enhance their chances of occurrence (Pérez-Liñán and Polga-Hecimovich 2016). When presidents lose their legislative shield (congressional majority) (Pérez-Liñán 2007) and their popular support, they are at risk of suffering an impeachment or being forced to resign (Pérez-Liñánis an essential feature to be considered, as three of Castillo’s predecessors had their presidencies interrupted. The elected president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (PPK), resigned after a corruption scandal. His vice, Martín Vizcarra, distanced himself from the president during the crisis while adopting an anti-corruption rhetoric to attain popular support. He was later impeached by a declaration of “moral incapacity” with the support of 105 congressional votes (being 87 of 130 the minimum required). That was the second congressional attempt to dismiss the president. After a first victory, Vizcarra had hardened the tone against Congress. He accused it of manipulating audios to falsely accuse him of corruption and stage a coup against him. Vizcarra was dismissed despite public reactions against the legislative, a corrupt institution barring anti-corruption initiatives in the public’s eyes. As the successor was a congressman (Manuel Merino), he faced heavy pressure from the streets and resigned after a few days in office.pressure from the streets and resigned after a few days in office.Like this recent turmoil in Peru, cases of repeated breakdowns occurred in different South American countries. In Ecuador, four presidents were ousted from 1997 to 2005 during a period of institutional malfunctioning. Reforms originally conceived to strengthen presidents’ policymaking abilities and curb incentives for corruption, in practice, blocked the formation of political coalitions, paving the way for instability (Mejía Acosta and Polga-Hecimovich 2010). In Argentina, during the convertibility crisis, three presidents did not finish their mandates. Fernando de la Rúa and Rodríguez resigned, while Eduardo Duhalde agreed to advance elections to avoid further political turmoil. Finally, in Bolivia, between 2003 and 2006, Sánchez Lozada, Carlos Mesa, and Rodríguez Veltzé resigned during a period of high intensity and generalized protests regarding the gas nationalization policy (Buitrago 2010).In all these countries, the aftermaths were similar. Presidents faced polarization and aggressive opposition since their inauguration. The previous unstable political context that prevented other presidents from finishing their mandates influenced their decisions to control other branches. These cases guard some differences, especially in Argentina where, despite interferences in the Central Bank, Judiciary branch (Helmke 2017), and Media by the Kirchners (Repoll 2010), institutions were relatively unharmed (Levitsky y Murillo 2008). Despite this, all used strategies often present during the ongoing third authocratization wave (started in 1994) (Lührmann and Lindberg 2019). They may be classified as hegemonic leaders that threatened democracies from the inside (Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018; Alizada et al. 2021) by concentrating power in the executive at the expense of the courts and the legislature, leading to the erosion of horizontal accountability (Coppedge 2017). These ‘incumbents legally access power and then gradually, but substantially, undermined democratic norms without abolishing key democratic institutions’ (Lührmann and Lindberg 2019, 1105).As in Latin America, presidents’ unilateral behavior to change constitutions to extend control over other branches are a particular risk for democracy (Pérez-Liñán, Schmidt, and Vairo 2019) this is a valid concern regarding Castillo. Some political groups interpreted the designation of Bellido as part of a plan to provoke Congress to deny the prime minister a vote of confidence. That would force the president to name a new cabinet and kicking off conditions for a congressional dissolution (allowed in the Peruvian Constitution after two votes of no confidence from Congress).As Castillo doesn’t have a congressional majority and, therefore, a legislative shield, we should expect that he will need to rely on popular support to maintain the office. That was not the case for the Kirchners and Evo Morales, but Rafael Correa. The Ecuadorian president also did not have a congressional majority. Therefore, rather than relying upon his predecessors’ failed strategies of forming ‘ghost coalitions,’ he did not allow any of his party members to run for Congress, calculating that he would never achieve a majoritarian position. Alternatively, he profited his high approval rates to undermine the Congress legitimacy (very unpopular by then) and push forward his proposal of holding a referendum on the election of a constituent assembly. Correa’s principal objective when aggrandizing his presidential powers could be to avoid the same destiny as his predecessors (Bermeo 2016). Therefore, ‘Correa’s decision to convoke a constituent assembly and dissolve the opposition-controlled legislature arose in good part from his fear of being removed.’ As ‘the president had no representatives in Congress, and executive-legislative relations quickly deteriorated into a struggle over which branch would survive’ (Helmke 2017, 123-24), he used this strategy to strengthen his presidential power and secure office. That reduced cooperation incentives for legislators demobilized the legislative opposition (Mejía Acosta and Polga-Hecimovich 2010) and consequently hampered Ecuadorianimpeachments serve to remove corrupt or hegemonic presidents (e.g., Alberto Fujimori), when oppositions use them for political reasons, they might harm democracies and deepen polarization (Carey et al. 2020). Using such instruments should only have a positive institutional impact when legally motivated and proceeded (del Tronco and Gorostiaga Guggiari 2020). While removing presidents that violate democratic principles should bring institutional strengthening, undemocratic behavior from the opposition may disrupt the rules of the game, turning an impeachment more dangerous than maintaining the president (Marsteintredet 2013). As anterior cases have shown, deliberately overthrowing presidents might drop citizens’ level of satisfaction with democracy, creating the conditions for the rise of hegemonic leaders.We should be especially concerned as Peru is going through a period of polarization. During such, partisan interests might prevail over democratic principles, with ordinary people being tacit (and sometimes explicit) grantors of autocratic leaders (Svolik 2019). Indeed, recent democratic backsliding derives from polarization. It results from the growing use of rage discourse and nationalist ideologies (Lührmann et al. 2018, 2019), the latter present in the second round of Peruvian elections.The Following Steps Might Lead the Way to Path DependenceAs Castillo does not have a legislative majority, he will need to rely on popular support to stay in office. While that might mean pushing his reformist agenda, he does not necessarily need to do so by overpassing Congress. The polarization highlights that a portion of the electorate only voted for Castillo in rejection of Fujimori. This electorate could be satisfied with moderate reforms.The elected president himself reassured that the nationalization of strategic sectors would respect private investments. He nominated Pedro Francke to head the Ministery of Economy, who met with investment banks to assure the government’s commitment to economic stability. Additionally, Julio Velarde, Peruvian central bank chief, in the job since 2006 and regarded as a guarantor of the country’s financial stability, accepted Castillo’s invitation to stay in the post.Initially, Congress responded to Castillo’s prime minister nomination by inviting Bellido to discuss, rather than immediately rejecting him. That moderate reaction is probably because of the recent Vizcarra legislature dissolution and signals congressional initial unwillingness to confront the president and further damage its image with public opinion. The desire from political elites to leave the recent political turmoil behind and avoid strengthening the outsider might help stabilize the country.Additionally, Castillo’s decisions regarding the economic nominees show that he is concerned about guaranteeing support from economic elites to enhance his governability, somewhat like did Lula in Brazil. Also, the elected president patiently waited for his nomination, delayed due to his opponent unwilling to accept her defeat.Alternatively, Keiko Fujimori, who will probably lead the opposition to the Castillo government, has shown the most undemocratic behavior when alleging fraud in the elections (discarded by electoral authorities). She was also behind the political scandal that motivated the impeachment trial against PPK, not approved in Congress but motivated his resignation. As the opposition leader during the political crisis when different presidents fell, she used controversial political manoeuvres to hamper their conditions to govern.If polarization will rise and if the political crisis endures, that will depend on the next steps from the president and the opposition, especially Fujimori. On the one side, the recent political turmoil with repeated presidential breakdowns, the ongoing processes of democratic erosion, and other examples from Latin America points out that the main concern should be Castillo. On the other, an aggressive opposition from political and economic elites and media conglomerates might also be a risk for democracy, as have occurred in the impeachments of Rousseff in Brazil and Lugo inpresident appears to have left his electoral rhetoric behind, but there are still several doubts. His intend to nationalize strategic sectors was a policy that won in the ballots. It is, therefore, legitimate. His cabinet nomination sent mixed signals, and the president of his party is willing to go far to create the constitutional assembly. Castillo holds the pen to make the most significant institutional damage but, so far, has the benefit of the doubt.Alternatively, Keiko is the political actor with the most undemocratic behavior in the recent past. She does not have the benefit of the doubt. Despite accepting her defeat, she promised to mobilize her supporters against Castillo and called the elections illegitimate.Keeping an Eye on FujimoriInstead of prematurely pointing the finger at Castillo, we should be concerned with Keiko Fujimori. The favorite candidate of the Peruvian elite and mainstream media has a problematic past. Beyond extolling the legacy of her father and being involved in numerous corruption scandals, she has undermined precedent governments.While Castillo has the incentive to leave elections behind and focus on achieving the political conditions to govern, Fujimori does not have anything else interesting on her plate besides attacking her adversary. Her next steps need to be closely watched. All in all, we should hope neither will prefer to escalate instead of seeking consensus, something unlikely considering the ongoing polarization."

The Nature of German Power During Europe’s Crisis Decade,Alberto Cunha,Aug 23 2021,"The debate on the theme of German domination or “hegemony” in the European Union (EU) has proliferated in the last decade, be it in the academic world, but also in political circles and the mass media (in Europe and in the Anglo-Saxon world). The resulting literature mentions not only the existence of such a domination but focuses on characterizing some of the aspects of its functioning, whether its non-military nature or its “civil / normative” or “geoeconomic” character. This debate became particularly pressing in the subsequent decade, which will be the period analyzed in this article. The trend towards leadership – or “hegemony”, depending on the source – of Germany within the EU would be maintained in the crises that followed the beginning of the so-called Euro crisis, namely the one caused by the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014 (Daehnhardt, 2015) and the refugee crisis with its peak in 2015(Meiritz, 2015).The simple fact that such a question could be posed, of a German hegemony within an EU created after the horror of World War II (which originated in the first place given the unresolved “German Question” of a German hegemony in the center of Europe), justifies the importance of understanding what is happening in the Europe of the last decade, Merkel’s Europe. The EU is by nature a “civil / normative power” where there is no need to use military means for an assertion of state power. That may have allowed Germany to transform its political, institutional, and structural power into what is possibly a form of regional hegemony; without the need, as in the past, to aim for territorial expansion or to have a prominent military force.This article is not intended to be a chronological description of the EU crises of the last decade or a detailed enumeration of the different decisions of Merkel’s government. Rather, the aim is to “step back” and reflect on how to classify the nature of Germany’s power in these crises and therefore within the EU as a whole; namely, to reflect on the characterization of said power by various authors as being a hegemony, which, if it were a reality, would have important consequences for the process of European integration and its evolution. Part of this work means, albeit briefly, thinking about the concept of ‘hegemony’ in itself, something that is not always done carefully by those who use it: hegemony remains a highly contested and ambiguous concept, with different meanings depending on the context in which it is used and the academic school or political perspective of the author in question (Anderson, 2017). As such, hegemony is a term often used to describe Germany’s pre-eminence in the EU, but it does not always satisfactorily explain why the German pre-eminence constitutes what can be qualified as a form of regional hegemony.From Reunification to MerkelWhen trying to understand the arc of European history from 1945 to the Merkel years, an obvious question regarding the potential German hegemony in Europe is: How did we get to this point? A reasonable start for an answer could simply be the economic and demographic size of Germany which, after its reunification in 1990, became the largest demographic and economic country in the EU, a status unlikely to change soon. While this is an important factor, it does not provide a sufficient explanation: in fact, the academic-political debate about Germany in the first decade after 1990 focused on the problems of the post-reunification country, culminating in its description as the “sick man of the euro” by The Economist (1999). This expression seemed to denote that Germany was not the dominant power in the EU or, that if it was, it remained temporarily unable to fully exercise such power/leadership due to its economicthe 1990s, the most attentive observer could observe a certain disconnect between some academics and the more conventional media: academics and political scientists, namely those belonging to the realist International Relations school, such as Mearsheimer, or geopolitical scholars such as Brzezinski or the German Mark Bassin, centered their analysis on Europe with references to the supposed predominance of Germany in the center of Europe and its potential to become the hegemonic power in Europe. Instead, the media (both inside and outside Germany) still focused on the perception of the crisis of the German socio-economic model and its supposed economic decline relative to the rest of Europe.Prior to Merkel’s government, which came to power in November 2005, another strand of literature focused on interpreting Germany as being a civilian power (Zivilmacht), deeply rooted in the post-World War II order. The origin of this concept comes from a “reflection (…) by François Duchêne on Europe in 1973” (Berenskoetter & Stritzel, 2019), and the concept was later adopted by academics such as Hanns Maull (2007, 2014, 2018). Authors working with this literature tend to consider Germany as a normative actor that has largely focused its foreign policy on values ​​it considers non-negotiable, such as avoiding the use of military force, pacifism, a reflexive pro-regional integration attitude, a pro-Western orientation (inheritance from Konrad Adenauer’s Westbindung) and a multilateral attitude in dealing with crises and disputes through international forums. According to scholars who sustain this line of argument, the regional role of reunified Germany would only be a continuation of the approach developed in post-1949 West Germany. Historically, Germany’s reluctance to act as a regional leader because of its difficulties in overcoming its Nazi past has meant that it was a sleeping European giant – Gulliver, in Sebastian Harnisch’s description (cit in Beasley, 2013) – who despite its size lacked the capacity to exercise political leadership in the EU when compared to countries like France or even the UK. Added to this argument of historical continuity was the reference to some of Germany’s structural weaknesses: the high dependence on its exports, chronic low rates of public investment, in addition to being plagued by “mini-jobs” (temporary low-paid jobs) and increasingly ageing population; not forgetting Germany’s relative military weakness in terms of manpower and equipment.In the same vein and with a similar interpretation of German power, the concept of “domesticated power” developed by Peter Katzenstein should also be mentioned, which, in the description of Berenskotter and Stritzel(2019), “highlights an intertwined, mutually constitutive relationship between German power and its institutional context in Europe”. With a primary objective of ensuring the “institutionalization of power” in Europe to “rough the edges of power relations” (Katzenstein, 1997, 3), such a system would allow states to project their power in a “soft” (non-aggressive) way, and simultaneously being shaped by them (Katzenstein, 1997, 3-6). It seems clear that by accepting such premises it would be difficult to conceive of the existence of a hegemony or even German leadership, which would be in such a way – in the path of the liberal institutionalist school – submerged in the common European institutions and structures in such a way that it would not have autonomy to exercise leadership without being collectively, in theduring the Merkel years: the ‘indispensable’ EU member-stateAt the turn of the century, Germany appeared to be no more of a leading state in the EU than France, its traditional partner and co-leader in the context of the so-called Franco-German axis. But this perception and the relatively benign (or reductive…) designations for German power in Europe would change during the early 21st century, and that’s where the concept of hegemony resurfaced in the public debate about Germany. This was a return to a concept that had never been used since 1945 to describe any of the Western European powers, but only the United States, as the undisputed hegemon in the Western world. In the decade after 2009 and with the onset of the Euro crisis, the perceived growth in Germany’s influence and power in the EU was a reality felt at the expense of all other EU member states and France in particular. Quoting a European official during the euro crisis, the situation became one in which “France needs Germany to disguise its weakness and Germany needs France to disguise its strength” (Economist, 2011). Thus, there were several politicians from European and non-European countries, including some with governmental responsibilities, establishing historical linkages with the first half of the 20th century to warn of the German resurgence in Europe.Despite having already been an important state in the EU, for example, in defining the rules of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in the 1990s (Baun, 2006), Germany had until then exercised its power and leadership in the EU in the context of the Franco-German axis, even serving as a junior partner for the French on matters of foreign and security policy. The outbreak of the Euro crisis and the need for a joint response to ensure the very survival of the European integration project provided an opportunity for Germany and Chancellor Merkel’s government to assert clear leadership in defining EU policies and its political evolution, whether in the areas of EMU or in the relationship with Russia, among others. Angela Merkel was considered the de facto leader of the European integration project, even though this political leadership is often opposed by other member states. Germany was thus now considered the ‘indispensable’ (Bulmer & Paterson, 2016, 1) member state of the EU, promoting its national interests while holding the EU together, by exercising its power in the EU during the multifaceted crises that plagued successively Europe in the years after 2009:The Euro crisis, which challenged the very existence of one of the main achievements of 70 years of European integration, the creation of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU);The crisis in Ukraine, starting in 2014, where, for the first time since World War II, there was a unilateral military intervention by one of the Great Powers in a European country – and coming in the sequence of the previous Georgia crisis of 2008;The Refugee crisis with its height in 2015/16 and which comprised Germany’s decision to (temporarily) open its borders to the influx of refugees from the Middle East, while faced with the determined refusal of countries like Hungary to open its borders or allow for a revision of the rules of the Schengen Agreement and the Dublin Convention on the reception of migrants. This was a crisis that affected the daily political, social and economic reality of many people in Europe, including Germany itself, and may be at the very least partially responsible for events such as Brexit (2016) and the entry into the Bundestag of the Alternative for Germany (AfD, in its German acronym), an extreme right-wing political force, in 2017.These successive crises severely affected the base of support for European integration in most Member States in different ways, but always with Germany as the lead state willing to provide solutions and promote its own solutions in common (as well as vetoing/blocking solutions it did not want implemented). It thus emerged as the “shaper” state of the EU’s response to three of the most serious crises in existence and which allowed it to remain united, avoiding so far what Webber (2019) called the potential for a process of European disintegration which could unravel 70 years of Europeanaddition to the aforementioned crises, there was of course the British vote in favor of leaving the EU (Brexit), which is also having a profound effect on the EU. However, despite the efforts of several senior British officials, this was a crisis where the EU’s response was clearly in the hands of its supranational institutions in Brussels (notably the Commission and its negotiating team led by Michel Barnier). In the other three crises, a certain power vacuum/political leadership in Brussels was, in fact, one of the big reasons why Germany had to – or chose to, according to the source – assert its own leadership, given the inability of the institutions supranational bodies to provide necessary solutions acceptable to most member states.The concept of ‘hegemony’According to the Financial Times review of Bulmer and Paterson’s 2018 work “there are two questions: has Germany become the hegemony of Europe and does German domestic politics inhibit it or help it to play that role?” (Barber, 2019). The work represents the culmination of more than a decade’s reflection on what they termed Germany’s “reluctantarticle was written after a decade in which Germany was almost unanimously regarded as the most influential and powerful EU member state after the “triple crisis” of the EU, regardless of the source, whether from academic experts, European and global media, as well as from senior officials from the EU and other member states (see for example Kundnani, 2015; Matthijs, 2016; Paterson, 2011; Schweiger, 2015; Stelzenmüller, 2016). Such a consideration was made both with a positive connotation, typically full of approving references to the existence of a German “leadership”, but also (and more and more often as the decade passed) with more negative connotations; with expressions such as “pay master” or, crucially for this article, “hegemony” (Bulmer & Paterson, 2015); with the latter concept employed with a negative connotation in the media and political actors, namely in countries that considered to be more negatively affected by German decisions and policies, such as Greece.On the other hand, speaking of German “leadership” remains a concept with a much more positive connotation, even if it is not clear why these two concepts have a positive/negative dichotomy; or which are exactly the conceptual differences between the two. Thus, a certain ambiguity or imprecision about the nature of German predominance in the EU supports even some of the most reputable analyses on this topic, even in the reflections of specialists such as Bulmer and Paterson; and it is precisely on this ambiguity that this article intends to contribute. Such contribution would be useful at a theoretical level in the scope of International Relations (I.R.) and Political Science, with a more careful consideration of the concept of “hegemony”. Additionally, it is intended to be a contribution of empirical interest, seeking to critically review the debate – which has been academic, but also political – about the nature of German power within the EU during the Merkel years.Before dealing more directly with Bulmer and Patersen’s argument and the debate to which they contributed, some clarification seems necessary, however brief, on the concept of “hegemony” itself. This concept is fascinating and easily evokes an image in the reader, but it often remains not very precisely defined and without agreement about what it involves or means, whether in the academic world or outside it. This opinion about the concept of “hegemony” is shared with scholars who have studied its origins and meaning. For example, Perry Anderson’s seminal book (2017) on the historical evolution of the concept “hegemony”, begins with the following statement: “Few terms are used so widely in the I.R literature. and political science, with so little agreement on its exact meaning, as ‘hegemony’”. The article by Berenskotter and Stritzel (2019, 10) can also be cited, who argued that despite the widespread use of the ‘label of hegemony’ both in academia and outside it, “in its benign and coercive connotation (…) it often remains conceptually somewhat superficial”.Although there are limitations to its use, there is a basic meaning that explains its popularity as a concept. Hegemony is a term with a connotation derived from its origins in Ancient Greece as hegemonia. This is because its first known use was to describe the very specific relationship of dominance that Athens exercised over a group of allied city-states against the Persian empire. In this relationship of dominance, Athens would coordinate such armies against the external threat, but without imposing direct domination, which meant that the city-states maintained their autonomy and sovereignty, even if they were still somehow subordinate to Athens. As such, and still to this day, ‘hegemony’ generically signals a state of predominance or control of one group over others; in the state system, which is the relevant meaning in this debate, it would mean that hegemony refers to a state of predominance or control of one state (Germany) over other less powerful states (the other EU memberhegemony has referred since ancient Greece to a predominance over others, it also implies a specific kind of predominance: as the historian Lentner (2005, 735) argued, it refers to any sort of “leadership of an alliance” rather than “domination by coercion”. Grote, a close associate of Stuart Mill, defined hegemony as referring to “leadership loosely based on agreement or consent”; in contrast to Arkhe, another word with Greek origins which refers to a “superior authority and coercive dignity of an empire”, eliciting only “acquiescence” and not “followers” – a followership which Hegemony typically implies.This distinction between followers and reluctant acquiescence/consent remains essential to understanding what distinguishes “hegemony” from other, more coercive forms of domination. Considering the nature of the EU, which allows a country without impressive military resources (such as Germany) to assume a role of political dominance over other states and at the same time offers it to different member states (even if they are less powerful) equal voting rights in the European institutions, the attractiveness of the term “hegemony” to designate the German phenomenon in Europe is surely understandable.The use of “hegemony” lied dormant for a long time after Ancient Greece, before experiencing a renaissance in 19th century Germany. This fact may be natural, given Germany’s enduring fascination with Ancient Greece; but it is also interesting to note that some of the earliest modern reflections on “hegemony” came from German authors. Just like today, they often disagreed on what the term implied. German historians Mommsen and Droysen found the term very useful to describe Prussia’s informal supremacy in the then German Confederation, referring to it as “hegemon”; as did Gervinus, a famous historian of the time, although he spoke of Prussia’s pre-eminence in what is now Germany as a “coercive” form of hegemony. On the other hand, on its study of Ancient Greece by another historian, Hans Schaefer, hegemony was referred to as a type of “limited” power (Anderson, 2017, 3).In the following century, a distinctly German historical perspective on hegemony emerged, with authors such as Cornelius Castoradis, Lars Hewel and especially Heinrich Triepel (1921). As Stritzel (2020, 4) mentioned, “Triepel conceptualizes hegemony as bestimmender Einfluss (‘decisive influence’) within closely linked groups of states”; it goes on to add that for Tripel, ‘decisive influence’ “is the result of a sustained process [over time], involving material and non-material factors”, distinguishing hegemony from domination (Herrschaft) and portraying ‘decisive influence’ as conditional on successful persuasion processes, Verständigung (understanding/accommodation). That is, much of the power of the hegemonic state is based on its ability to be accepted by other states, which would become “followers” ​​of the hegemonic power.Such reflections on the meaning of hegemony put a strong emphasis on the need for the hegemon to be followed by the other states, which is somewhat ironic when considering the strong opposition elicited against the German government during the Euro crisis, in countries like Greece; or during the Refugee crisis, in countries like Hungary. On the other hand, they allow for a better understanding of the nature of the followership that Germany enjoyed among the countries of northern Europe during the Euro crisis, which were often more ‘German’ in their policies than the German government itself; and maybe even to refer to the relative unanimity of the EU over the German leadership in responding to the Russian annexation ofthe academic and non-academic literature that mentions “hegemony” to describe the context of Germany within the EU, the most common theoretical approach on which such descriptions are based upon is Hegemonic Stability Theory (HST in its English acronym). Economist Charles Kindleberger (1981) is generally considered the pioneer of this theory, with a central statement that “a hegemonic leader is the state powerful enough to bear the necessary costs of cooperation and shape the rules of multilateral institutions”; but there is also an interpretation of the theory by I.R. scholars (see for example Gilpin, 1981; Gilpin, 1987; Keohane, 1980). Keohane exposes the central assertion of HST as one in which hegemonic power structures, dominated by a state, are more conducive to the development of strong international regimes, whose roles are relatively precise and well obeyed – which could be a possible description for the current system functioning of the EU and in particular the EMU with German as the dominant state.According to the HST, the dominant state, in order to function as hegemony, would guarantee the availability of political and economic benefits for the entire system, the so-called ‘public goods’, which include “reduction of transaction costs, establishment of credible commitments, facilitation of collective action, creation of focal points and monitoring” (Reich & Lebow, 2014, 21). The provision of this hegemonic role would ensure the stability of all states in the system, even as the hegemonic state itself benefits from its predominance in the system, with a leadership out of self-interest and not altruism.In the case of the Euro crisis, Germany supported and financed the creation of “public goods”, albeit with a strong conditionality largely defined by German decision-makers. There was also a strong German imprint in new institutions such as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), created during the height of the euro crisis with the objective of managing loans (obtained with the mandatory counterpart and ‘supervised’ by the ESM of carrying out “structural reforms”) to member states that need it. The ESM has independence from supranational institutions such as the European Commission, which means that it has significant power and autonomy in crisis situations. It is no coincidence that this institution is led by a German economist, Klaus Regling, continuing a tradition of incorporating German economic thought into European institutions, considered by several authors as inspired by the thought of Ordoliberalism – which in southern European countries is often criticized as an “austerity” thought. This domain of German thought was not only present in the type of bailout approved during the euro crisis and in the creation of institutions such as the ESM (Feld et al, 2015; Nedergaard, 2013), but also in the creation of the whole system itself. The statutes of the European Central Bank (ECB), which were decided in the 1990s, bore according to the unanimity of observers a decisive German imprint which meant that the ECB central mandate is primarily anti-inflationary, in line with the German tradition, rather than one which also attributes priority to Economic Growth, such as the US Federal Bank Reserve, more in line with KeynesianGermany as ‘Reluctant hegemony’ or ‘semi-hegemony’ during EU’s crisis decadeMax Weber defined in 1921 power “as the ability to get what you want and control the behavior of others against opposition and obstacles”. The three crises referred to above showed Germany’s ability to use the EU to, as Weber put it rather crudely, “get what it wants” and “control the behavior of others”. Thus, with a window of opportunity for Germany to hold a clear lead in defining EU policy over all other Member States (including France), it is clear why the analysis of what is happening with the German power in Europe and the mention of an eventual ‘hegemony’ seems more natural. What seems less natural is the existence of such a situation in a Union which was founded in part with the purpose of avoiding concerted power in a single state, particularly Germany, given its history in the first half of the 20th century (a memory that opponents of German power during the Euro crisis did not shy away from recalling).About the nature of hegemony and the definition of Germany as a regional hegemonic power in the European Union, there has been great interest by I.R. academics, especially during the period covered by this article. The notion of Germany as the hegemony of the EU has gained significant traction among many scholars (such as Maull 2018; Schönberger 2012, 2013; Kundnani 2011, 2015; Paterson 2011; Bulmer & Paterson 2013, 2016; 2019). Furthermore, this is also a notion that has spread to mainstream media and non-scientific policy analyses. The work of Bulmer and Paterson was particularly influential, introducing the concept of Germany as a “reluctant hegemony”, which was made mainstream by “The Economist”(2013) when referring to the leadership of Germany in largely defining the parameters of a solution to the crisis in some of the Southern European countries of the Eurozone. Bulmer and Paterson would continue to use the concept of “reluctant hegemony” to describe Germany’s pre-eminence in the EU. On the same topic, other authors also participated in the debate, expanding or contesting the definition by Bulmer and Paterson (such as Jenning & Müller 2016; Kunz 2015; Matthijs 2016; Harnisch 2017; Crawford & Rezai 2017).Implicit as a central statement in this literature is the idea that Germany (while maintaining its pro-European rhetoric) has transformed the very nature of the EU integration process, a union of equals which originally bore a strong French imprint, “using its financial and economic power (…) to promote its own national interests” (Bulmer & Paterson, 2010, 1057-1058). Another implicit statement addresses the nature of Germany’s predominance in the EU: despite its alleged attachment to the European integration project, its hegemonic approach means that German national interests often prevail over its “Europeanism”. In both cases, these authors use “hegemony” with a negative connotation in a critique of the excessive predominance of Germany, centered on two facets:Germany’s exaggerated influence on the EU institutions, which Crawford referred to in 2007 as an “Embedded hegemony”, noting Germany’s growing assertiveness in promoting national interests within the Brussels institutions. Varoufakis (2016) was one of the authors (one that was famously directly involved in the crisis) who sought to demonstrate this assertiveness in the specific context of the resolution of the euro crisis in Greece, both in relation to the German government and to the German power within the European institutions;Germany’s lack of attempt to involve other EU member states in the decision-making process and in particular during crisis decision-making. This was a prevalent charge even in relatively popular actions outside Germany, such as the (temporary, as it turned out) opening of German borders at the height of the refugee crisis. In this crisis, Germany unilaterally took the decision on the reception of refugees in 2015 without any prior vote in Brussels or even coordination with most other governments of the EU, even though this directly affected all other member states and arguably further pushed the Schengen system to the brink.Many of the advanced concepts about German power sought to explain the combination of these two facets, which resulted in a broad body of definitions about Germany’s role in Europe, from which three will be reviewed in this article: reluctant hegemony, semi-hegemony and geo-economic power.The first two concepts seem to be somewhat linked, in keeping with the notion that Germany’s hegemonic status is somehow ‘incomplete’ or semi-hegemonic, which is justified with several reasons: either because of Germany’s ‘reluctance’ to be the hegemony of Europe, caused primarily by the impact of significant internal restrictions on the German public and political system (Bulmer & Paterson, 2018); but also, rather as an intentional approach of the Merkel’s governments and German decision-makers in general (Matthijs, 2016).As such, the idea that Germany constitutes an ‘incomplete’ type of hegemonic power is echoed in several contemporary analyzes of German power over the past decade. One of the examples of this thought was Hans Kundnani (2015) and his definition of Germany as a “semi-hegemony”. Kundnani, and the other authors that use this definition, identify an important aspect of Germany’s sui generis pre-dominance, which is the fact that it does not possess a sufficient resource advantage (when compared to other countries in the region such as France or the United Kingdom) to be a “full” hegemonic power when contrary to the Western hegemony as claimed for by the United States from 1945 up to the present day. Although Germany indeed has the largest population in the EU, it is not disproportionately larger than the other major EU states; and although its economy is larger, only the amounts of the German external trade surplus can be considered disproportionate, which is largely due to the German economic structure (based on the Rhine Capitalist model, still far more industrialized than the rest of the EU) as it developed after 1945. It is also due to economic choices of German governments in controlling wages in export sectors, namely those taken during the Schröder government (1998-2005), as the ‘Agenda 2010’. That is, although Germany has a relative advantage in resources that would always make it an important power in Europe, they would not necessarily guarantee the preponderance it had in the decisions of the Euro crisis (or the Ukraine crisis) and certainly do not substantiate a ‘hegemony’, even if incomplete.Kundnani, however, does not justify his concept sufficiently. It remains largely unclear what are the characteristics of German power and leadership in the EU that make it a “semi-hegemonic” power; nor does he locate the concept of “semi-hegemony” in the broader context of various academic approaches already mentioned on the concept, be it within Political Science or I.R. If properly developed and theorized, the concept of “semi-hegemony” has some academic potential, but it is never used as more than a “label”: further work on refining this description through an academic lens would in my view be an important contribution to future work on this topic, and one which hopefully can properly apply the concept of “classic” hegemony to the concrete reality of Germany in the context of the EU.Another problem which I identify arises when it is assumed that Germany’s hegemony is “incomplete” because there is an internal reluctance of the country to assume this role. On the contrary, I would argue that it should not automatically be assumed that such incompleteness is necessarily against the German national interests. Looking critically, I consider that the opposite may even be true: the basic assumption that its hegemony is somehow incomplete or semi-hegemony effectively absolves Germany from political responsibility for the consequences of its decisions on EU leadership when convenient and yet it allows Berlin to act decisively when its interests are at stake – either decisively shaping the solutions adopted by the EU / or vetoing solutions that would benefit other member states. This acquittal of responsibility has serious consequences, given that in this way Germany can continue to refute criticism for the way its power operates within the European institutions. Moreover, such acquittal is particularly acute when the German lead on EU Crisis decision-making continues to be characterized by factors such as the three outlined below.Firstly, the lack of consistent agreement on the part of other EU member states in relation to the concrete measures taken by Germany when it takes the lead in crisis situations, observed in the Euro crisis (by the southern countries of the Eurozone) and during the Refugee crisis (mainly by the Eastern Member States, where terms such as “moral imperialism” were used). This was caused by the normalization of the resistance by an increasing number of member-states to decisions taken unilaterally by Germany (even if with the best intentions) but which affect the whole of the EU. In this context, terms such as ‘Skepticism’, ‘Ambivalence’ and ‘Resistance’ (as in Greece during the Euro crisis or by the eastern governments during the refugee crisis) by the member states are justified, even though said countries should be followers of the German leadership, according to the often referenced Hegemonic theory, namely HST. It was no coincidence that the crisis in Ukraine, the only one in which Germany clearly agreed to self-inflict a price to its national interests – by imposing sanctions on Russia that wounded its strong economic ties with that country – was, in the last decade, the only in which the political leadership of Germany was more widely accepted by the rest of the EU.Secondly, the strong conditionality that Germany imposed on the more dependent EU member-states (mainly observed with the Debtor countries in the Euro crisis) to ensure the supply of the kind of ‘public goods’ that hegemonic powers provide in order to maintain the overall stability of the system in a way which is widely accepted by other states. Such a conditionality was not present when the USA first assumed the mantle of Hegemon of the Western world, according to HST, after 1945, with the “Marshall Plan”. But when it came to the Eurozone, the agreed solutions instead forced countries to internal devaluation and strict adjustment in a time of stark economic depression and without popular domestic support. Not only there was nothing resembling a “Marshall Plan”, but instead came a refusal to seriously consider solutions like Eurobonds or temporary fiscal transfers that would have at least eased a very unilateral adjustment process that fell almost entirely upon the populations of the debtor countries of Southern Europe, and especially Greece. The consequences were disastrous and caused prolonged and very serious economic contractions; in the case of Greece, the deepest economic crisis ever recorded by a developed country in peace times, coupled with massive flight of talented and educated young people. The crystallization of this German posture was the various support programs approved for countries such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland and supervised, largely in accordance with the designs of Berlin, by a troika composed of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund – whose presence Merkel was insistent on in order to give her support. In seeking this policy, much criticized in southern Europe and even internationally by famous economists such as Krugman and Stiglitz, it is no wonder that Germany has combined its role as the “savior of the Euro” with the leadership of the group of “creditors” in northern Europe, against the “debtors” of southern Europe.Thirdly, and finally, the refusal, shared by all dominant political forces in Germany, to apply more of its economic resources to make Germany a military force befitting its political weight and becoming a country with a much greater weight in alliances like the NATO and do away with what Americans and even other Europeans consider their “free riding”. There has been an evolution since the compromise agreed at the 2014 NATO summit (the same year as Russia’s annexation of Crimea), from which the German military budget has been slightly increased. However, successive years of lack of investment in the German army continue to have their effects: an official report by the Military Commissioner of the German parliament, quoted by Deutsche Welle (2018), stated that less than 50% of the main weapons systems in the German armed forces were ready for interventions, or even for training their military forces.In this way, Germany’s ‘reluctance’ can in my opinion be interpreted critically as something more closely resembling ‘selfishness’ at times: despite the permanent rhetoric about Europe, it seems rather that what counts more are national interests, the dictates of the German public opinion, the German political balance or the limits imposed by some of the “veto” powers of the German political system. Germany is not alone in behaving as a Power of this kind, and since Lord Palmerston we know that “the only eternal thing in the states is their interests”; however, such logic clashes with the notion of a Germany that has always declared itself during this period of crisis as ‘Europeanist’ and seeking to save the EU, a fact for which Merkel was not infrequently acclaimed.Another aspect of the nature of German predominance is that such German policies are structural and thus go far beyond Merkel. The weight of German institutions must not be downplayed, and the analysis of Germany in the EU should go deeper than an excessive focus on the analysis of the Chancellor’s personality and political style. In fact, even within Germany, Merkel was not necessarily the “toughest” position in the context of the Euro crisis: Schäuble’s public proposal for a forced Greek exit from the Eurozone, which did not have the approval of the German Chancellor, should be remembered. One can also consider the enormous power that German domestic institutions already hold within the EU, with the greatest example being the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe, which has always stood firm on occasions where it could have yielded to the European consensus. This Court not infrequently issued decisive opinions on EU policies that could or could not be supported by the Merkel government and in what form, which meant rather telling: the entire EU awaiting the decision of the court of one of its 28 member states. It was a clear affirmation of the Germanic preponderance, an indispensable power that, even if it didn’t get everything it wanted within the EU, certainly wouldn’t have anything it did not want.The most classic example of this power of German intuitions was the issue of the creation of Eurobonds, defended by numerous European governments and international observers and economists, but always outright rejected by Berlin, with the partial justification that it would never be accepted by the German Constitutional Court, even if it somehow became a policy of the German Government. This meant that an institution that was created as a balance on German counter-power had rather the opposite effect of “strengthening the back” and further solidifying the policy positions of the German leadership in EU negotiations. When this Eurobond idea was put to Merkel in 2012 and even after the joint declared support of France (the newly elected President Hollande, who had defeated the more pro-German Sarkozy), Spain and Italy – the three biggest economies of the Eurozone after Germany itself – Merkel replied that it would not happen “during my life” (Brown, 2012) and the fact that its approval by the Constitutional Court seemed impossible made this refusal even more definitive and credible. As of 2021, it has never ever been remotely conceivable that such a solution would be implemented, even though numerous economists have come out in support of it.Alternative reflections about the nature of German PowerAnother systematic reflection on the nature of German hegemony in Europe is condensed in the assertion that contemporary Germany acts as a “geoeconomic power” in Europe. Although similar conceptions have previously described Germany as a trading state that prioritizes wealth and prosperity and emphasizes trade and multilateral cooperation in relation to defense and security policies (Rosecrance, 1986; Staack, 2000), this argument gained a somewhat more ‘assertive’ reinterpretation with Kundnani and Stephen F. Szabo. The interpretation of German power as “geoeconomic” could explain Germany’s apparent paradox – being both an economic giant and a military “dwarf” – by defining the country as mostly interested in economic and financial power gains rather than the traditional geopolitics supported by a strong military force.In my view, this reflection is questionable, or at least it should be accepted with caution. In its central assertion that Germany’s policies are primarily pursued in its economic interests, it fails to explain the response to the Ukraine crisis. Following its logic, Germany could not have assumed the leading role it played in imposing economic sanctions on Russia, when it was the member state that would lose the most absolutely, given the enormous number of its businesses directly affected by the sanctions and also the weight of Russia for its export-based economy (Webber, 2019).In the concrete case of the Ukrainian crisis, Germany was always clear in its opposition to a “militarization” of this crisis and more specifically opposed either to a NATO intervention or to the arming of Ukrainian forces in the fight against the separatists supported by Putin’s Russia, rather placing the priority burden on preserving unity within the EU. In the words of then-German Foreign Minister Steinmeier: “preserving this unity and sharing the burden of leadership are Germany’s top priorities (…) In other words: Germany’s partners shouldn’t expect too much from Berlin through more military contributions: ‘politics before force’” (Maull, 2018, 464). In commenting on this clear position of the Merkel government, many authors have returned to the aforementioned notion of Germany as the example of a “civilian power” popularized by Hanns Maull.Maull presented several relevant insights into how Germany exercises and does not exercise power. In particular, he seems to capture what Stelzenmüller characterized as the lack of vision and strategy in the conduct of German foreign policy. For this author, Germany can have a lot of Power, but without the necessary sense of purpose, vision, and strategy to lead in external crises such as the Ukraine crisis, even considering its clear predominance in the economic and financial sphere of EU: “Germany has now acquired full sovereignty but has not regained strategic autonomy in the classical understanding of freedom of action” (Stelzenmüller, 2016, 55). Hyde-Price (2015), in a similar vein, suggests that Germany is a ‘giant’, although it suffers from ‘sleepwalking’, and refers to Germany’s ‘weak strategic culture’.I find however that perceiving Germany as being politically oriented by its civilian power profile, while capturing some basic features of its decision-making nature on foreign policy, is not entirely convincing. Namely, the basic theoretical premise assumed by Maull (2018, 467), that power is “a concept and a phenomenon that is closely linked to causality”, can lead to the error, referred to in Berenskotter and Stritzel (2019, 8), of “thinking that ‘civil means’ are used only in productive and cooperative ways (in terms of “power to / with”), although they can be easily mobilized to sustain a hierarchy and can have coercive effects”. On this point, suffice for the readers to recall that the exercise of German power during the Euro crisis in Greece or Portugal was certainly ‘civil’ (and not military) but that did not stop it being both assertive and decisive. Additionally, Maull does not seem to consider sufficiently that the explanation of German ambivalence about the use of military force is largely a direct impact of the decentralization and parliamentary centrality in German political decisions – in a way completely unknown in powers like the US or France, in which such decisions are very centralized in the person of the President. This means that Germany can with a shift in public opinion not so closely follow the “Civilian Power” approach: the example of the military intervention in Kosovo in 1999, in which the German public was convinced by the center-left government that the need to help prevent a genocide should outweigh the reluctance to use military forces, is a good example of how this ‘civilian’ status is not necessarily permanent.This concept is also addressed by a broader criticism by Eberle (2019) on the inconsistency of the debate on German power, with a focus on the popularity of the latter concepts here reviewed – “Civil Power” and “Geoeconomic Power”. As the author points out, these concepts are at both extremes of a view of Germany (maybe implying even a selfish vs. altruist lens) and he considers that they cannot provide a grand narrative of how German power actually works in practice. While broadly agreeing, I would state that it could perhaps be possible to reconcile these concepts by using a typically ‘realistic’ focus: the primacy of the German national interest. Seen through this lens, it emerges in my view a much clearer continuity in Germany’s actions and decision in the “triple crisis”: Germany only provides leadership when it suits it; which is not that uncommon for a powerful state, even if it is not particularly “Pro-European”.A perspective built upon the centrality of German national interests as drivers for its political decisions (or non-decisions) would help explain some of the characteristics of German dominance that Eberle and others identified: the inconsistency, both temporal (very strong in the Euro crisis, almost non-existent in the Brexit negotiations) and “sectoral” (most pressing in economics, almost non-existent in the security domain and European defense) of the German dominance in the EU. It also relates well to the observed resistance that arises in situations where German national interests do not correlate with the interests of less powerful states (whether Greece in the Euro crisis or Visegard’s countries during the refugee crisis), even if those German interest are rhetorically advertised as being “European” – as they often are – instead of merely German.Conclusions and the German view on this debateBecause it reflects on a topic so widely debated – both in academia and outside it – this article does not escape from being just another small contribution to a growing body of literature that poses such questions, and it does not always manage to offer definitive answers. I hope I have demonstrated that this topic is not only timely and relevant from a scientific point of view, but also has an undeniable political relevance, given the importance of defining and clarifying Germany’s role in Europe, which no member state escapes and which it has effects well beyond the borders of the EU. I also hope to have contributed to the notion that, conceptually, there is a gap in the literature about how this German hegemony can be defined, both theoretically, with regard to the concept of ‘hegemony’ as understood in a I.R. sense; and empirically, in how such a concept can be put to the test against how German power actually works in the EU system. This gap, which this article aims to help become clearer, can be summarized by the following paradox: while the term ‘hegemony’ is the most often used to describe Germany’s status in the EU, hegemony remains a highly contested and somewhat vague in the context of IR and Political Science in general.The process of European integration has formed, incrementally, a Union whose ties and mutual economic dependence have no historical precedents for states that remain nominally independent: open borders, a common supreme court or (for the Eurozone) a common currency, are typically seen as attributes of a nation-state and yet the EU already possesses them. This fact contributed to Germany being able to transform its structural power into an ideational hegemony and into an institutional power superior to any other member state.However, a better understanding of whether the German “hegemony” exists and how it works is an important task that many are still struggling with, more than a decade after the start of the Euro crisis and on the year in which Angela Merkel will leave, after four terms, the leadership of Germany. It is the task of scientific research and future political debate to reach conclusions about the present and future course of Europe with Germany at its center. Thomas Mann’s famous dictum of desiring a European Germany and not a German Europe has had a curious resolution over the last decade: a European-oriented Germany that, even so, seems increasingly to be leading (certainly in the Euro crisis) a “German Europe”.Additionally, the concept of German hegemony, as it has been used, denotes some lack of interest in studying the growing importance of the EU’s supranational institutions, such as the European Parliament and the Commission. And, also, on other institutions in the pan-European political space, namely EU party families, as well as European Business Groups and Labor Unions. This emerging genuinely European socio-economic sphere is one through which power can be transmitted and shaped within the EU, at a European rather than national level. The existence of genuine supranational characteristics within the EU system does not necessarily exclude the existence of a German hegemony; but they must still be considered in a serious analysis of hegemony, as there are arguments to be made as to the emerging pan-European institutions. If translated to politics, could this one day transcend the borders of member states in ways that have not been done as of this moment (whether due to linguistic, cultural, historical or political barriers)? The question deserves to be considered.Most of the debate about German power and its hegemony in the EU is carried out by external observers. So, it seems natural to conclude with a look at the thinking and concepts that prevail in Germany itself, where Germans, contrary to popular belief, increasingly want to openly discuss their role in the EU and how better to use German power. Some German foreign policy experts (see for instance Speck, 2012) continue to deny that ‘hegemony’ is an adequate concept to define Germany’s status in the EU, while others argue that Berlin’s occasional hegemonic decisions are unnecessary (Kunz, 2015). On the other hand, some of the debate is quite self-critical: scholars like Habermas or Beck regularly identify and criticize the existence of a “German Europe”, in a strand of literature that considers Germany as hegemonic in Europe, largely as a consequence of the global economic crisis. As noted by Bruno and Finzi (2018), “Jürgen Habermas tends to focus on the intentional, structural and inevitable nature of the new role played by Germany in view of its size and economic importance after reunification” while “authors such as Ulrich Beck highlight the importance of contingency issues, that is, the asymmetric impact of the economic crisis”. However, their conclusion about Germany’s central or even hegemonic role is similar.A rather constructive part of the debate on the nature of German power has been led by the German government itself: then-German Defense Minister Von der Leyen proposed in 2015 the concept of “leading from the center” to describe Germany’s role in the EU while former German President Gauck (2014) spoke about the German responsibility to use its power. Then-foreign minister Steinmeier (2016) defined Germany’s approach as the ‘main enabler’ in the EU and a ‘reflective power’, with the premise that Germany over the past two decades has been pushed to a central role in European and global affairs by profound changes in the international order – one which Germany must continue to be a factor of continuity and stability. In this decade, according to such view, those global changes thus forced Germany to “reinterpret the principles that guided its foreign policy for half a century” (Maull, 2018, 464).Finally, an official German Government document (Bundesregierung, 2012) referred to Germany as a Gestaltungsmacht, that is, creative or molding power. Although the elements of the discourse of ‘benign hegemony’ are visible, the Gestaltungsmacht would not occur within a hierarchy configuration, but within cooperative and networked relationships. As current Foreign Minister Maas emphasized in the Bundestag, “our international shaping power remains (…) above all, with the coherence/solidarity [Geschlossenheit] of Europe” (Maas, 2018, 1)."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/22/opinion-the-fate-and-the-folly-of-the-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan/,Opinion – The Fate and the Folly of the US Withdrawal from Afghanistan,Alexander Brotman,Aug 22 2021,"The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and the Taliban’s swift takeover of the country has produced searing and devastating images, with regional and global ripple effects likely to be felt for decades. The decision to end the war in Afghanistan is not a controversial one, as a majority of Americans across the political spectrum support what Biden is doing. Biden’s message from the White House on 16 August recognized these strong poll numbers and was targeted solely for an American audience, including those in the swing states that he managed to wrestle back from Trump in the 2020 election. Biden did not speak to the Afghan people and placed much of the blame on the corrupt Afghan governments of the past 20 years, as well as his predecessor Donald Trump.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg concurred with Biden’s assessment and also blamed Afghan leaders for the collapse of the Afghan military. Only at the end of the week did Biden begin to address the looming humanitarian crisis and the plight of ordinary Afghans struggling to leave the country.In 2016, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found that the number of Afghan forces willing and able to fight for their country was highly exaggerated, and that many ‘ghost soldiers’ existed as a byproduct of Afghan corruption. The lack of morale and willingness to fight on the part of the Afghan army when compared to the messianic drive of the Taliban was well-documented but not fully acknowledged by US policymakers, including Biden. While Biden stated confidently in July that the Taliban was unlikely to take control of Afghanistan, intelligence reports painted a more dire picture. The Taliban were gaining ground rapidly, and Kabul’s security, as well as the safe passage of American citizens and Afghan partners could have been more thoughtfully organized.For Biden, the scenes playing out in Kabul are a tragic side effect of what he perceives to be a necessary, and popular, political decision. This decision is solely for a domestic audience that has grown weary of 20 years of war and desires increased nation-building at home rather than abroad. In so doing, Biden is building on Trump’s theme of placing ‘America First’, albeit with a significant twist. For Biden, this introspection and strengthening of American democracy, institutions, and even infrastructure cannot come at the expense of losing America’s allies. However, in asserting this new policy, America’s traditional NATO allies have been rankled by the events of the past week and the lack of an orderly exit.The chaotic exit is a disruptive event for America’s allies and adversaries, and it marks a critical juncture in the transfer and dispersal of power around the globe. When the dust finally settles on Kabul, 2021 is likely to mark the start of America’s first true post-9/11 foreign policy. The nebulous and at times jingoistic framework of the ‘War on Terror’ is no longer destined to be the organizing principle for future U.S. militaryunilateral withdrawal from Afghanistan also places pressure on NATO allies and raises fundamental questions about the alliance’s aims and legitimacy in the post-Cold War era. Czech President Milos Zeman believes NATO’s legitimacy has been questioned by its failure in Afghanistan, and the head of the Christian Democratic Union party in Germany, and possible successor to Chancellor Merkel, Armin Laschet, has called the Afghanistan withdrawal the ’biggest debacle’ in NATO history. For a presidency built on repairing and strengthening the transatlantic alliance after Trump, Biden is now faced with European allies who view the recent history of NATO’s actions, and the U.S. withdrawal, as fundamentally divisive and against their national interests.As Biden pivots to other threats and a focus on countering China, the era of unbridled US-led missions within NATO may be finally coming to an end. Calls for European strategic autonomy are also likely to increase, as Washington’s foreign policy objectives are increasingly questioned. Washington’s oldest NATO allies have witnessed the United States move from an era of bipolarity during the Cold War to one of unmatched primacy, and now great power competition once again with China. In contrast, Washington’s newest NATO allies in Central and Eastern Europe have witnessed American power primarily in the context of its engagements in Iraq and Afghanistan. These conflicts have produced the ripple effects of failed states, Islamist terror, and mass migration, leading to a resurgence of populist and nativist forces that have destabilized European politics.Now out of the EU but still a principal player in NATO, the UK was one of America’s strongest allies in the War on Terror at a time when both France and Germany had serious doubts about US-led missions. The dismay of Biden’s actions from prominent defence and foreign policy figures in the UK like Tom Tugendhat and Rory Stewart is notable in the sense of betrayal, personal grief, and humiliation it has brought to them personally, and to their country. Both Tugendhat and Stewart have called the withdrawal from Afghanistan the UK’s biggest foreign policy disaster since the Suez crisis of 1956. For them, it is a brutal sign of the UK’s inability to successfully extricate itself from American-led military interventions that have had tragic and destabilizing consequences.In delivering on one of his most deeply felt beliefs and campaign promises, Biden risks unraveling an already fraught alliance and damaging the credibility he rightly instills in so many American allies. There is still time to regain control, however it requires Biden to tap into the two traits that have so endeared him with voters over the years: humility and empathy. Humility after the hubris of a 20-year war is an important remedy to help raise a nation back to its humble origins. 20 years after 9/11, the Taliban are once again in control with a range of U.S. military equipment at their disposal, and the terror risk emanating from Afghanistan is likely to increase.This is a propaganda coup for America’s adversaries, but for Biden, it is also an opportunity. In ‘building back better’ at home, a more solid foundation of American power, defined by the power of example, can at last be permitted to emerge abroad. In the immediate aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal, this power is not yet visible. However, Biden is betting on the inevitability of American power over the long-term. Whether or not America’s allies are willing to go along with him and bet on America’s enlightened return is the critical question in the wake of Afghanistan’sReading on E-International RelationsWhat Happened to the Afghan Peace Talks?Reflections on Afghanistan: War is Folly for the Weak on Wisdom and WillA New Taliban Leadership and Peace Prospects in AfghanistanOpinion – International Humanitarian Law Should Have Been Part of the Taliban Deal“No Friend of Iran”: Tehran’s Responses to the Taliban’s Return to Power in AfghanistanSurveying Opinion on Withdrawing US Troops from Afghanistan and South KoreaAbout The Author(s)Alexander Brotman is a political risk and due diligence analyst with a focus on EU politics and security developments.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/19/opinion-what-if-afghanistan-had-its-own-gandhi/,Opinion – What If Afghanistan Had Its Own Gandhi?,Jaimin Parikh,Aug 19 2021,"As I celebrated India’s 75th Independence Day on 15th August a sudden thought arose of whether Afghanistan could have been free and independent had they had someone like Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in their homeland. To complete this thought experiment I will not go into diplomatic, social, and cultural reasons of what happened and how it happened in Afghanistan as the Taliban returned to power, but will explore the probable way an “Afghan Gandhi” (which could be an individual of any gender, or even an organization) would have led the struggle. Mahatma Gandhi’s struggle against political tyranny was based on two elements which were always a part of whatever decisions and struggle he had carried – satyagrah or path of truth and ahimsa or non-violence. From non-cooperation to civil disobedience – and from personal life to the political sphere – these are the yardsticks of understanding Gandhi’s methods to deal with peace and conflict resolution.An “Afghan Gandhi” would have realized that Kabul doesn’t only need political stability but also eternal peace and permanent conflict resolution. Political stability can be maintained through force, diplomacy, bombs, and gunfire but peace cannot. Peace is a more holistic approach that requires winning heart through rationale and logic by adopting the path of truth and non-violence. The question may arise – “Cannot political stability automatically led to peace and resolve the conflict once the democratic system is established?”. The straightforward answer to this, what an “Afghan Gandhi” would have given, is “No. Not at all”. The reason lies in the fact that be it a political struggle or personal life, one cannot separate “means” from the “ends” i.e. to say that peace cannot be achieved through non-peaceful methods. This is because by going through violent means to achieve the ends of stability – which is wrongfully perceived as peace – one tends to create violent mindsets which emerge later on to destroy the perceived peace (the stability).Hence, an “Afghan Gandhi” would have had opted for a personal as well as political struggle based on truth and non-violence via the methods of non-cooperation and civil disobedience during the first undemocratic regime of the Taliban from 1996. The masses of Afghanistan would have been urged to get themselves physically and mentally prepared for the pain and suffering they would go through to transform their country permanently. The ‘suffering’ because they would have adopted the path of non-violence and truth by being ready to bravely face the punishment by the tyrants but not co-operating with their dictatorial orders to maintain Taliban-style law and order.Next, would have been a request for the people to boycott all the offices, institutions, and governing bodies in which the tyrants were involved thereby disobeying and breaking the oppressive rules and laws. The basic idea is twofold: first, the tyrants cannot continue the rule without cooperation and obedience of people at the grassroots who are well aware of ‘know-hows’ of institutions like industries, banks, hospitals, etc. and second, appealing to the conscience of the oppressors to ‘change’ its nature. Further, once a subset of people would have been free from the fear of the oppressor then no force could stop them from spreading the same fearlessness and rationale ideas to their fellow Afghans.Also, any “Afghan Gandhi” would have appealed to the masses to do constructive works like promoting and providing education to all, spreading the tolerant nature to accept the criticisms, promoting inter-cultural harmony, working towards enhancing scientific skills and temperament among all, and others. This could have been done by using the same tool which the oppressor has been using ever since to promote hatred, intolerance, and bigotry – such as the Quran. By invoking various aspects of the text which promote the constructive works mentioned, the “Afghan Gandhi” would have positively influenced the population as well as countered the Taliban in their language.combination of the two processes mentioned above would have had a material impact on the Taliban. Either they would have ‘changed’ if appeals reached their conscience or they would lose their popular support. By doing this, the “Afghan Gandhi” would have also countered the recurrent narrative about external forces interfering in the country. Hence, among all the major fronts the Taliban would have been defeated.Considering the past, the question arises of whether we can expect this “Afghan Gandhi” to emerge in the time ahead?. To answer this let me quote Gandhi from 15th August 1947 when he sent a message to ministers of cabinet:From today, you have to wear the crown of thorns. Strive ceaselessly to cultivate truth and non-violence. Now, you will be tested through and through… Beware of power; power corrupts.As a matter of fact, the Taliban has made the same mistake that others did. In order to achieve their own version of stability and peace they forgot that ends can never justify the means and hence the offshoots of discontent and instability, which I described earlier in this article, are bound to come in near future. Even if it doesn’t get highlighted internationally it will be present at grassroots in various forms. This is where the “Afghan Gandhi” can bear – at grassroots – and can follow the Gandhian methods of truce.The responsibility which would lie on the shoulders of this prospective “Afghan Gandhi” would be to follow the methods of transformation and not destruction in order to positively influence the masses to get ready for physical and mental pain which they will have to go through in process of truth and non-violence and then finally bring the grassroots democracy. The lesson of Afghanistan is that one cannot expect that peace, stability, nationalism, and conflict resolution can be ‘enforced’. Rather these have to be grown and nurtured from within – from the grassroots. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/18/opinion-rwanda-and-the-drc-converging-at-last/,Opinion – Rwanda and the DRC: Converging at Last?,Edoardo Monaco,Aug 18 2021,"On June 27, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda signed three agreements on bilateral cooperation after a meeting between the two heads of state – Rwandan President Paul Kagame and his Congolese counterpart Felix Tshisekedi – in the capital of the DRC’s North Kivu Province, Goma. The agreements covered aspects like the promotion and protection of investments, avoidance of double taxation and tax evasion between the two countries, and gold mining cooperation. Broader discussions also took place on regional security, the recent eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as the integration of the DRC into the East African Community.The symbolical significance of the event, though, transcends the formal coverage of the talks. After years of conflict and tensions, in fact, these two adjacent nations have de facto come together, without the evident brokerage of a major third party, to mend ties and promote dialogue and cooperation.This détente could not come a moment too soon for a region blessed with vast natural resources and human capital, yet long plagued by common troubles. Particularly brutal and exploitative forms of European colonisation left the DRC and Rwanda completely devoid of physical, social and politico-economic infrastructures for growth and nation-building. Furthermore, a legacy of ethnic cleavages, artificially exacerbated for decades as an expedient to maintain colonial control, weighed heavily on the development patterns of the two countries long after independence.The vast, resource rich DRC was subjected to the infamous ambitions of Leopold II, King of the Belgians, who from 1885 managed the Congo Free State, essentially, as private property and in personal union, before the government decided to annex it as Belgian Congo in 1908, amid international condemnation for the large-scale atrocities committed against locals in a macabre attempt to enhance rubber and copper productivity. Foreign interference continued even after the independence in 1960, as the newly established Republic of the Congo soon faced a complex existential crisis. Secessionist movements arose in Katanga and South Kasai, followed by a coup that overthrew the first elected prime minister, Patrice Lumumba, and the ultimate seizing of power, in 1965, by Mobutu Sese Seko, whose proverbially kleptocratic and authoritarian rule would go on to last for 32 years.In Rwanda, instead, the divisive policies of German (until World War I) and Belgian colonizers aimed at rather meticulously classifying the local population on the basis of ethnicity. The Tutsi minority – about 10% of the local population – was proactively involved in the administration of the colony, while Hutus actually represented the overwhelming majority (over 80%). This legacy of division and resentment persisted and “brewed” over the years, de facto setting the stage for the killing, in 1994, of over 800,000 mostly Rwandan Tutsis at the hands of Hutu extremist groups. No actor from the Global North or any multilateral organisation (e.g. United Nations Assistance Mission to Rwanda, or UNAMIR) was able to prevent the genocide, despite their presence in the region both before and during the horrific events that unfolded between the months of April andcircumstances surrounding the genocide of 1994 and its aftermath soon spilled over into the adjacent Eastern DRC. There, key Hutu rebel génocidaires (e.g. “Forces Démocratiques de Libération du Rwanda”, or FDLR) had fled to escape retaliation from Kigali’s restored central government, controlled by the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), ultimately ushering the two countries into a season of rather continuous open conflict often referred to as the “Congo Wars” (1996-97 and 1998-2003).Rwanda, in fact, increasingly concerned about the hostile Hutu presence near its borders and frustrated by Mobutu’s inability to control the region, resolved to take matters into its own hands by promoting the ultimately successful replacement of Mobutu with the more closely aligned Laurent Kabila in 1997. However, not much time passed before Rwanda turned against Kabila himself (and his son Joseph, who succeeded him in 2001) too, for very similar reasons. The “wars” ended up involving several other African nations – such as Burundi and Uganda on Rwanda’s side, and Chad and Sudan on the DRC’s – causing 4 million deaths and displacing at least 2 million in the process.Yet, Kinshasa’s dysfunctional central government and the persisting presence of rebel offshoots and remnants of the Congo Wars kept causing unrest in Eastern DRC (especially in the Orientale, North and South Kivu Provinces) and tensions with neighboring Rwanda well beyond the formal cessation of hostilities in 2003. Armed groups that remained active in the region, in fact, included the FDLR, the “Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo” or FARDC, as well as allegedly Kigali-backed groups like the “Congrès National pour la Défense du Peuple” (CNDP) – before the capture of its leader Laurent Nkunda in 2009 – and the “Mouvement du 23-mars” (M23).The fact that these two nations have decided to meet (in Goma, no less) and resort to formal, direct bilateral dialogue is an encouraging step that might bode well for the development of both.A significant portion of the vast mineral resources that the DRC is naturally endowed with – including the highly coveted “3T’s and G” (tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold) – lies exactly in the restive Eastern region, whose pacification would hopefully pave the way for a more effective governance of the mining activities (in many cases still artisanal in nature). This could also allow the country to overcome market challenges like those posed by the American Dodd-Frank Act (section 1502 in particular) of 2010, aimed at reducing the export of so-called conflict minerals – i.e. minerals originating from mines controlled by rebel groups using revenues to finance their guerrilla movements – by imposing hefty due-diligence and disclosure requirements on any US-listed company sourcing from the broader Great Lakes Region. This legislation, in fact, has led to the unintended consequence of “scaring off” many foreign buyers, who would misguidedly perceive the problem as far more ubiquitous and pervasive than research demonstrated it to be – resulting in massive job and livelihood losses on the ground.Against all odds, Rwanda – a small, landlocked country that, unlike the DRC, is not particularly blessed with natural resources – has risen from the ashes of a violent tragedy of immense proportions to become a beacon of growth, hope and reconciliation for the rest of Africa and beyond. Under the controversial leadership of President Paul Kagame – former RPF commander, in office ever since 2000 (till, potentially, 2034, thanks to ad-hoc constitutional reforms adopted in 2015) – the country has been making great strides in the realms of land tenure, women empowerment, agricultural value chains, as well as sectors like eco-tourism, air travel and ICT.Important pre-conditions for sustainable socio-economic progress are, at any latitude, peace and stability. In particular, good neighbourly relations after years of conflict, acrimony and wasted opportunities can significantly improve the chances for both nations to positively impact one another. This is especially true considering the high degree of complementarity of the two economies: one (DRC’s) endowed with immense natural resources, a vast territory and an abundant workforce eager to escape poverty; the other, landlocked and relying on far smaller territory and population, yet eyeing further rapid progress especially in the services and manufacturing sectors.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/18/opinion-arrestlucknowgirl-a-reminder-of-indias-postcolonial-desire-to-control-women/,Opinion – #arrestlucknowgirl: A Reminder of India’s Postcolonial Desire to Control Women,Ankita Rathour,Aug 18 2021,"In early August 2021, the hashtag #arrestlucknowgirl was trending in India. In a viral video dated July 30, one can see a woman in a white t-shirt and jeans thrashing a cab driver at the Kesari Kheda traffic crossing in Lucknow’s Krishna Nagar. A First Information Report (FIR) was registered against this woman as outrage sparked on social media. While the woman said the cab driver was at fault, the driver threatened suicide urging the police to take action. Feminists will not deny the obvious violence in the video. Violence is not okay and the woman is clearly at fault. But I wonder if this righteous online rage against the “Lucknow girl” functioned from a deep-seated misogynist appetite of punishing women. Where is this outrage when women/girls are gang-raped, killed in broad daylight, and forcefully cremated? Where are such so-called demands of justice knowing that at least ten Dalit women are raped every day? Such a line of questioning is not whataboutism. Attention must be called to misguided calls for justice.For example, in the case of Bollywood actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death last year, cries of “justice for SSR” were acted out through brazen misogyny against Sushant’s girlfriend, Rhea Chakraborty. In name of justice, women were classified as good and evil. Sushant’s ex-girlfriend was cast as the prior while Chakraborty was the latter. This in turn gave rise to shameless online abuses hurled at her and her family.Within this fictional world of good versus evil, anyone sympathizing with Rhea Chakraborty was considered a bad woman, bad person, bad Hindu, and in extension a bad Indian. Fact and fiction merged as masculine-nationalist demands for justice began normalizing violence and imprisonment as correctional tools. The pattern continued in the Lucknow case. Violence and state-sanctioned controlling of women appear desirable in order to restore digressing women to the so-called ideal of right-wing Hindu goodness. That is why imprisoned female Indian activists do not find public support. Their imprisonment is seen as something they deserve since they protested the Hindu state. In their desire to seek fairness, these misguided calls of justice end up demanding more violence, more gendered state control.In postcolonial India, women have been a potent site to construct unique Indian nationalism and ideal femininity. Nationalist masculine violence and state-sanctioned repression have historically been the desired way to restore digressing women to the tenets of ideal femininity. Gender theorists and historians like Urvashi Butalia, Ania Loomba, and many more have prolifically engaged with the intersection of nationalism and native patriarchy in creating ideals of Indian womanhood. Instead of benefitting India and its women, such intersections only strengthened traditional casteist Hindu gender codes. These scholars have also illuminated the role violence plays in constructing ideals of Hindu womanhood in post-partition India.For example, After partition, Hindu women were forcibly retrieved from Pakistan in India’s desperate attempt to solidify its national identity; consent did not matter. The Indian state recruited its women to carry out such forced retrieval. Families separated. Lovers died by suicide. During the Sati era, many Hindu men and women argued that self-immolation was a widow’s choice. They wanted to restrict colonial state interference in their affairs. In the ideological battles of colonizer vs native, foreign vs Indian, women faced repercussions, sometimes violent, and always epistemological. With hashtags like #arrestlucknowgirl, one can see residues of anxious nationalist masculinity acting out. These anxieties are more inclined on penalizingmust not forget that the Lucknow case was also a class-based assault. It’s not simply a woman beating a man, but a woman with more class privilege assaulting a man who she considers less human than her. Such violence mimics patriarchy and emerges from various intersections. Historical and cultural subjugation of women has left women with unresolved trauma and frustration. A culture where gender-based violence becomes as normal as the day leaves survivors of such violence with no other choice than to find recourse in more violence. In other words, the abused turns abuser.Violence is seen as the seductive imperative to feeling powerful in a heavily capitalist-patriarchal society. Inept police system has left frustrated, traumatized people all around. The woman in the Lucknow case has claimed that she was being harassed for the past year and had gone to the police for the same, but no action had been taken yet. Legal lethargy frustrates women trying to seek justice in a patriarchal society. Hence, violent outbursts become a way to make sense of a continuously senseless reality. This does not mean that the “Lucknow girl” is not wrong. It only means that the issue is not as simple as we would prefer it to be.Furthermore, rising global capitalist ideology renders certain people like the cab driver in this case vulnerable to violence from many sides. He is as vulnerable to a man’s assault as a woman’s assault as police brutality. Sadly, when these frustrations collide, chaos takes a massive form, and penalizing women appear an easy solution. The woman in the Lucknow case deserves legal action for her outright dehumanizing behavior. But would punishing her solve deeper cultural problems? Did vicious attacks on Rhea Chakraborty solve the issues of mental health, pandemic depression, and drug abuse? No.Hashtags calling to punish women are temporary reliefs. Performative holier than thou attitudes on social media are not solutions. The root causes of such issues are gender insensitivity, class disparity, systemic casteism, and structural patriarchy to name a few. We are in this together and calls to punish some women are never going to make the world safer for all women. Neither such calls are going to benefit defenseless men. They are simply going to widen the chasm between men and women, giving rise to uncontrolled brutalism. We should begin engaging with postcolonial Indian feminist consciousness by denouncing violence strongly without universalizing a stand-alone issue. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/16/managing-chinas-rise-lessons-from-1914/,Managing China’s Rise: Lessons from 1914,Andrew Latham,Aug 16 2021,"That China is a power seeking to move to the center stage of world politics, no one can doubt. That this will inevitably result in war is a much more dubious proposition. This is not to suggest that China’s rise will necessarily be peaceful. The argument that the economies of both powers are so intertwined as to make war unthinkable is reminiscent of similar fairy tales that people – including prominent intellectuals like Norman Angell – were telling themselves about Europe’s great powers in the summer of 1914. Nor are any of the other soothing sounds emanating from the sirens of splendid globalism terribly convincing. But neither is it to suggest that China’s rise will inexorably result in a global conflagration. Thucydides argued over two millennia ago that wars are not merely the result of big structural forces like tectonic shifts in the balance of power. Instead, they are the product of the interaction of these big structural forces and with events: political decisions, diplomatic signaling, military moves, alliance dynamics, and so on. In China’s case, the tectonic shifts have already occurred. The PRC has arrived at a point where, structurally, it poses a real challenge to US hegemony. Systemic, hegemonic, or world war is, therefore, a real possibility. But it is not a foregone conclusion. The specific outcome will be determined by the concrete actions taken by political leaders in the US, China, and elsewhere – actions that will either amplify the structural tendency toward war or flatten the curve in ways that allow war to be avoided.Let me illustrate the nature of this current moment by drawing a historical parallel between China’s rise today and Germany’s rise in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It has been done before, I know. Indeed, it has become something of a favorite with those who see a Thucydides Trap around every historical corner. But I’m going to approach it a little differently. Specifically, I’m going to sketch a plausible counterfactual scenario in which Germany’s rise resulted in a systemic crisis in 1914 but did not result in a world war. That will allow me to isolate the factor or factors that led to peace in my counterfactual scenario where war had been the outcome of the actual historical crisis of 1914. And that, in turn, should shed some light on China’s rise today.Such counterfactual thought experiments can, of course, be mishandled: The “what-if” premise can be arbitrary, alternative historical pathways can be hopelessly speculative and, at the end of the day, the alternative outcome can be little more than an endorsement of the author’s priors. Indeed, as the historian E.H. Carr put it, any history that begins with the words “what if” is little more than a “parlour game.”Done well, however – that is, with due attention to potential methodological pitfalls – counterfactual histories allow us to draw causal inferences by hypothesizing that factor x made a crucial contribution to outcome y and then deleting or modifying x and seeing if y remains a plausible outcome. If it does not, then it is possible to assert with some confidence that x caused y; if it does, then causality is much more questionable. Counterfactual histories also alert us to the role of contingency in human affairs, challenging the deterministic account that focus on the inexorable working out of this or that historical process.The method, of course, is always suggestive or probabilistic. History cannot be rerun and repeated in the manner of a scientific experiment, and we can never know for certain what the outcome of any changes to x would have had. But in the skilled hands of historians such as Andrew Roberts and Niall Ferguson counterfactual experiments have proven helpful in both isolating key factors leading to specific historical event and sensitizing us more broadly to the complex interplay of chance and necessity leading to any historical phenomenon.In this article I will adhere to the generally accepted protocols for doing counterfactual history. In particular, I will follow Max Weber’s advice and attempt only a minimal or plausible rewrite of history, hewing as close as possible to the actual history and venturing no farther than the first-order consequences of my tweaking of historical antecedents. I will also adhere as close as possible to what we know about the debates and calculations within the British and German foreign policy establishments, considering as plausible only those alternatives that can be shown on the basis of contemporary evidence to have been actually considered byPowers: Wilhelmine Germany, Xi’s ChinaBefore entering into a discussion of the July Crisis and outbreak of war in 1914, let me first lay the predicate for my argument by establishing that the rise of Germany in the early 20th century and the rise of China in the early 21st parallel each other in a number of important ways.To start, the two cases are similar in that they both involved a rising power seeking its ‘place in the sun’ – a term coined by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1901 to refer to the central position on the world stage he sought for Germany. Both also involve the rising power initially adopting a strategy designed to create a secure space within which it could build its power in relative security. Bismarck famously used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany’s position in a peaceful Europe, juggling a very complex set of alliances to maintain Germany’s security and position within the European order. Similarly, China adopted a strategy of “hide and bide” in which it adopted a non-threatening posture and constructive engagement on the global stage.In both cases, however, an inflection point was reached at which the rising power decided it was ready to assume preeminence on the world stage, but felt it was being blocked, frustrated, or ‘contained’ by the existing hegemon.In the German case, the first signs of this emerged with Kaiser Wilhelm II’s ascension to the throne in 1888. Wilhelm opposed Bismarck’s balance-of-power foreign policy, preferring bold and aggressive efforts to secure Germany’s place in the sun. In China’s case, it began with the ascension of Hu Jintao in 2003 but accelerated when Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. On Xi’s watch, China decisively abandoned the strategy of ‘biding time’ and even Hu’s ‘peaceful rise’ variant in favor of one of “moving to centre stage.”In Europe in the early 20th century and the Western Pacific in the early 21st, this dynamic culminated in an unstable balance of power, in which a rising power believed it was being stymied and contained by status quo powers, and status quo powers feared that they would be picked off one by one by that rising power.And, finally, in both the German and Chinese cases, instability was compounded by concerns that demography was working against them in the long run. For Germany the fear was not of absolute decline, but of being decisively outstripped by Russia. German military and political leaders were obsessed Russia’s accelerating industrialization, the development of its (dual-use) railroads and the explosive growth of its population base. In China’s case, the concerns are with demographic collapse – China’s population is both shrinking and getting older – and with the prospects of being ensnared in in the so-called “middle income trap.” The problem in Germany’s case was, and in China’s case is, one of a faltering power seeing its window of opportunity closing and being tempted to act before that window closed firmly shut.While the two cases are not identical, of course, they are similar enough that the lessons learned from the German case can be usefully applied to that of China. In the next section, I develop a counterfactual history of the July Crisis in which that crisis did not result in a world war. My goal is to demonstrate not only that there was nothing inevitable about Germany’s rising leading to a global conflagration, but that a more more prudent strategy of offshore balancing on Britain’s part would have led to the same sort of peaceful resolution of the crisis as in the case of the Agadir Crisis ofJuly Crisis: War AvertedFrom about 1912, the actual arc of Germany’s rise began to bend rapidly in the direction of war. But war did not erupt in 1914 because of any ironclad law of history or Thucydides Trap. Nor did Germany go war against the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Britain because Germany’s leaders believed that they could easily cement their rise to regional hegemony by quickly and decisively defeating France and Russia and then bullying Britain into accepting German pre-eminence.No. As historian David Fromkin put it succinctly in his book Europe’s Last Summer: Who Started the Great War in 1914?: ‘Germany deliberately started a European war to keep from being overtaken by Russia.’ The argument Fromkin and like-minded historians make is that German military planners, looking East, saw a Russia growing demographically, developing industrially, and building the kind of rail and road infrastructure necessary for rapid mobilization in time of war. And this terrified them. Indeed, it terrified them so much that they decided that they needed to trigger a war sooner rather than later because sooner they might have some chance of defeating Russia and its allies, whereas later, they would simply be crushed by them. This, against the backdrop of their racialized fear of conquest by Slavs, drove the Germans to issue the now infamous ‘blank check’ encouraging the Austrians to punish the Serbs for their role in the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, to undertake concerted efforts to frustrate British and French peace initiatives, and ultimately to launch an attack on France through Belgium that brought the wavering British firmly into the war on the Allied side.And they did all of this to bring about war with Russia before that country had completed its economic and military modernization and before population growth bequeathed the Tsarist empire a conscript pool that dwarfed that of the Kaiser’s. It was a war of desperation.This being the case, it seems reasonable to assume that Britain could have changed Germany’s strategic calculus and kept it from leaping through a closing window by convincing Germany the window was already closed – that a war in 1914 was as unwinnable as the one Berlin feared fighting in the dreaded future. Indeed, it had done during the Agadir crisis only a few years earlier. In that crisis, the deployment of a substantial force of French troops to the interior of Morocco in April 1911 prompted the deployment of a German gunboat to the Agadir, a Moroccan port. Playing on fears that this might ultimately result in Germany acquiring a permanent naval facility on the Atlantic, Foreign Secretary Sir Edward Grey was able to overcome the non-interventionist majority in the Cabinet and induce the government to send a clear signal to Berlin that London considered Germany’s actions an unacceptable threat to the European balance of power. Britain sent warships to Morocco and there was open talk of war if Germany didn’t back down. In the end, Berlin relented, entering into an agreement with Paris and withdrawing its warship from Agadir. As in 1914, in 1911 Germany was rising and flexing its muscles and a crisis ensued. Unlike in 1914, Britain showed resolve, raising the costs of German revisionism. As a result, in 1911 Berlin judged the risk of war unacceptable and backed down. Again unlike in 1914, war was averted.The reasons for Britain’s failure to signal 1911-like resolve in 1914 are complex and multilayered, involving changes in the nature of Britain’s governing coalition, and the all-consuming nature of the Irish Home Rule issue. The bottom line however, is clear: during the period immediately prior to and during the July Crisis London was reduced to sending mixed and vacillating signals regarding how it would respond to the gathering Germana result, neither friend nor foe was sure what Britain would do and this ambiguity allowed German military and civilian leaders to convince themselves that the time was ripe for a final push for continental pre-eminence. As a result, when Archduke Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in July 1914, Germany rolled the dice. Sizing up the correlation of forces, and deciding that Britain would either stay out or make an irrelevant military gesture, German forces invaded Belgium and France. And the rest, as they say, is history.But let us rewind the historical tape and make a simple – yet eminently plausible – change to the actually existing history of the July Crisis. Let us assume that beginning around 1912, Britain had more deftly played its role as offshore balancer. Specifically, let us assume that it had done two things that, in reality, it did not. First, let us assume that London clearly and unequivocally signaled its support for the French and Russian balancers. There was support for this in the cabinet, the Foreign Office and the military and Agadir had demonstrated that this could work. London might have sent troops to France earlier, used it fleet to signal British resolve, sent clear and unambiguous diplomatic signals as it did in 1911, and done whatever else was within its power to convince Germany that the prospects of victory in 1914 were no better that at some imagined future date. These were live options.In reality, of course, these voices lost out. But had things turned out differently – had the voices favoring a tougher and less vacillating line with Germany won out – it is not unrealistic to assume that such a recalibration of the correlation of forces would have altered German calculations such that the status quo would have been preferable to any attempt to alter it via the use of force. Again, there is ample evidence that there were those in the German foreign policy establishment who firmly believed that Britain would either stay out or could be maneuvered into doing so. Had these key players, mostly in the civilian leadership but also a minority within Germany’s military leadership, understood that Britain was absolutely resolved not to allow Germany to coerce it neighbors into submission – into accepting German hegemony on the continent – then the July Crisis of 1914 might have resolved itself as did the Agadir Crisis of 1911. The assassination of Archduke Ferdinand would not have prompted Germany to issue the so-called “blank check” to Austria-Hungary, Berlin wouldn’t have worked to frustrate last-minute attempts to reach a negotiated settlement, Russia would not have been prodded into mobilizing, Germany would not have rolled the dice and attacked France through Belgium, and the world would not have slithered over the edge into a cataclysmic world war.Lessons LearnedWhat does this counterfactual tell us about the rise of China today? First, it suggests that, as in 1914, the structural conditions-of-possibility for a hegemonic war are clearly in place. China now, like Germany then, aspires to regional dominance and a more central role on the world stage – at least if President Xi is to be believed. Britain then, like the US today, had a strong interest in preventing an aspiring regional hegemon from overturning a regional order favorable to its interests. Then as now the result was, if not quite a geopolitical tinderbox, then a situation in which a crisis has the potential to degenerate into a systemic war.Second, however, it suggests that in the early 21st century, as in the early 20th, the rise of a challenger, with all the geopolitical flux and instability that entails, does not necessarily have to culminate in systemic war. There was nothing inevitable or foreordained about the First World War. Rather, that conflict was the product of many factors, some structural and some contingent. Chief among them, though, was the failure of British diplomacy, and specifically Britain’s failure to implement its centuries-old grand strategy of offshore balancing as it had done successfully during the Agadir Crisis. Had Britain acted differently, had it signaled more clearly and credibly its interests and its resolve to defend those interests, the outcome of the crisis of July 1914 would have been different. A risen Germany would have assumed its place at the heart of the European order, but would not have dominated that order in the way that it sought to by invading Belgium, France, and Russia in 1914. Strategic ambiguity – or, less charitably, vacillation – did not help the cause of peace and stability in the early 20th century. And it will not do so today. This counterfactual strongly suggests that if – or, rather, when – the US and China find themselves in a crisis, the cause of peace and stability will best be served by clear and credible signaling of US intentions, interests and red lines. This may seem intuitively obvious. But for those who require persuasion, the 1914 case drives home the pointfinally, this counterfactual also suggests that such clear and credible signaling is likely to be exceedingly difficult, complicated as much by domestic political factors as by geopolitical ones. In the 1914 case, Britain had to find a way to balance Germany without emboldening France and Russia. That is, it had to find a way of sending signals to Germany – both before and during the crisis – that were clear and unambiguous enough to deter German aggression or adventurism without issuing its own blank check to France and Russia. This proved challenging given both the ﻿domestic and intergovernmental politics within the various European capitals and the complexity and unpredictability of diplomatic interactions in the European international system as a whole.Focusing, as this counterfactual has, on the decisive British role in the outbreak of war. It is important to remember that during almost the entire tenure of the country’s Liberal government (1905-15) those cabinet members who advocated a strong line with Germany were outnumbered by those who did not favor such a line. In 1911, Foreign Secretary Grey managed to get his way because he could count on the support of both the Conservatives in parliament and influential military officers who had the ear of liberal MPs. In 1914, while non-interventionists remained in the majority, Conservative and military opposition to the Irish Home Rule Bill meant that Grey could no longer count on this support as both Conservative MPs and senior military leaders believed the army would be needed in Ireland and so could not be spared even for a mere show of force on the Continent. ﻿As a result, while the essentials of Grey’s hardline policy remained in place, between 1911 and 1914, he had to walk a tightrope between clearly conveying Britain’s red lines to Germany and the insistence of the non-interventionists in cabinet that he do no such thing. Needless to say, this balancing act compounded the complexity of Grey’s task enormously. If the Foreign Secretary ultimately erred on the side of not adequately signaling British resolve in the run up to the July Crisis – in the process baffling and vexing French, Russian and German policy-makers – he can thus perhaps be forgiven. Such were the realities of British parliamentary politics and the country’s domestic politics more broadly.Either way, though, Britain failed to implement its strategy of offshore balancing effectively. Had it done so – had Grey found a way to replicate his success in 1911 – the result of the July Crisis of 1914 would have been similar to that of the Agadir Crisis of 1911: revisionism blunted, a balance maintained, an order preserved, and a war avoided. While the situation in the early 20th century differs in many ways from that of the early 21st, as a resolution to a crisis these outcomes are as desirable now as they were then. Let’s hope that in any future Sino-American crisis, US policy-makers have more success managing both the foreign and domestic politics than did Sir Edward. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/15/opinion-the-olympic-games-as-a-reflection-of-global-power/,Opinion – The Olympic Games as a Reflection of Global Power,Lev Topor,Aug 15 2021,"What is a great power, and specifically, what can define a great power? This is a difficult and complex question many great thinkers and practitioners in the field of international relations have attempted to answer. Ultimately, the nature of a possible answer depends greatly whether one is a realist or a liberal. The debate is non less than eternal with great ‘academic powers’ battling, or just vigorously debating at the very least, in conferences, articles and books on the very nature of international power – From Kenneth Waltz to Joseph Nye. My argument here, much of which is based on a more realistic approach, is that the tally of medals in the Olympic games can describe the global arena and specifically the balance or distribution of power.During the recent Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, I have realized that an element which can define great powers and describe the global system is success in sport mega-events like the Olympic Games. Even though the official Olympic motto is “Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together”, I take a far more pragmatic approach to this event and argue that the Olympic Games are another platform on which global powers compete. The Olympic games may market “togetherness” on the outside, but the games are nothing more than an individualistic competition between nations to show one another who dominates the global arena – just without the use of force or economic pressure.I argue that the tally of medal counts can suggest which nations are powerful enough to dominate the Olympics and consequently – the world. On 8 August 2021, the last day of the event, only one nation gained over one hundred medals – the United States. Indeed, all individual and team victories by competitors are impressive expressions of human spirit and perseverance. Those who won, and even those who merely competed, deserve the admiration and adoration of sport enthusiasts worldwide. However, one cannot but wonder how some nations manage to present record breakers and champions by the hundreds or by the dozens and other nations can hardly present one.What can explain the success of great powers in the Olympic Games and in the international arena? Demographic significance might sound as a good explanation at first, but how can one explain the United Kingdom’s sixty-five medals for its approximately sixty-seven million people compared to India’s seven medals for over a billion people? How can one compare the American lead, with over three hundred million in population, over China which by now approaches one and a half billion people? Countries like India or even Israel with its four medals might be treated as regional powers as they have significant military and economic power, but can they actually stand head to head with the highest ranked nations?Should power be measured by the number of nuclear weapons, aircraft and tanks? Should it be measured by economic strength or cultural appeal? Can the membership in international alliances be part of the equation? The answer is complex, power should be measured by all these factors. But what turns a nation into a great power? As Waltz has put it in his 1979 Theory of International Relations (p.131), a great power is one which has significance in population, territory, resource endowments, economic capabilities, military strength, political stability and competence. I base my argument on Waltz’s insights and assume that resource endowments, generally but also in sports and education, are very significant for the analysis of the globalcorrelation between medal counts and power may seem unrelated as individuals or teams are those who run, swim, jump, grapple, box and sweat for the medals. Yet, the most prestigious sport events can only be conquered by those who are nurtured properly. Thus, nations which cannot adequately educate and train their representatives have less resources to spare in general or on sports. If a strong and wealthy nation cannot allocate resources for the training and education of its representatives, it might mean that this nation it not at all strong or wealthy enough to dominate the global arena or its related regional arena. For instance, North Korea and Iran may have space programs or attempted to develop nuclear capabilities, but it was done at the expense of their citizens.Furthermore, medal counts in events like the Olympic Games or world championships can suggest whether a global system is unipolar, bipolar or multipolar (or nonpolar). That is, a nation’s endowment for sports and education, despite the many complexities of the global system like economic problems, conflicts and wars or even pandemics, can indicate its strength. If a nation seeks global hegemony, this nation will attempt to be victorious not only on the battlefield or in global markets, but also in other and softer events like the Olympic Games.The official Olympic creed is “The important thing in life is not the triumph, but the fight; the essential thing is not to have won, but to have fought well.” Yet, I cannot think of a single nation, large or small, powerful or weak, liberal and progressive or conservative and autocratic, that might find this sentence appealing. Nations seek power and dominance or, at the very least, to have the ability of making independent decisions and not be dictated by others.What can describe the global arena and the balance or distribution of power? Scholars tend to describe the global system by mentioning key events in global history like wars, crises or peace treaties. I argue that sports mega-events should be considered more seriously as each Olympic Games or a short series of them can describe global shift in international presence and dominance. After World War II, the global arena could be described as bipolar with the United States (US) and the Soviet Union its key players. This bipolar system of course was divided between the West and the East. It was also divided between the five sovereign nations which grasped a permanent seat at the United Nations (UN) Security Council in 1945, making the bipolar system slightly less bipolar and more multipolar (United States, United Kingdom, Russian Federation, China, France).Now, the list of global powers includes the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and Germany. In 2021, a possible list of ten great powers, in a descending order, might include the United States, China, Russia, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), France, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Another possible list can include India, Japan, Iran and Israel. These lists are based on economic capabilities or military strength. However, as I argue, these lists of global powers and thus the description of the global arena can be adjusted more precisely. If one seeks to grasp a more complete understanding of the global system one needs to count medals, not aircraft or tanks.Finally, let us count medals and place nations in a descending order – let us describe the global balance of power. This can help answer the questions of which nation dominates the global arena and which are just behind, breathing down the hegemon’s neck? By the end of these Olympic Games in Tokyo, the most significant global powers are the United States, China, Russia, the United Kingdom and Japan, in this order. Australia, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and France are just behind. As it seems, the United States, China and Russia still dominate the global arena. Furthermore, not only a medal count can describe regional arenas as well, but it can also describe the international arena more precisely by combining the number of medals in eachReading on E-International RelationsOpinion – The Long History of the Olympic Industry and Totalitarian RegimesCommercial(ized) Nationalism on Display at the OlympicsOpinion – Coronavirus: A Global Crisis Waiting for a Global ResponseThe Global South as a Political ProjectOpinion – China’s e-Renminbi as a Fiscal Silk Road?Opinion – Vaccine Nationalism and the Global PrecariatAbout The Author(s)Dr. Lev Topor is a Senior Research Fellow at the Center for Cyber Law and Policy at the University of Haifa, Israel and the co-author (with Jonathan Fox) of Why Do People Discriminate Against Jews?

Apart from the various other sociological factors of caste, class and region, the project of a majoritarian Hindu Rashtra (nation) is sought to be achieved by way of silencing and disempowering the citizens. There is a concerted attempt to create fear and conspiracy. There have been spate of interconnected events in the recent past including the snoopgate controversy currently rocking the Parliament. It is believed that close to 1500 people have been targeted using the spyware, which includes journalists (40 of them belonging to leading dailies), academics, activists, industrialists, Constitutional functionaries, including judges, military officials and bureaucrats in the Election Commission.Recent investigations revealed that many of the accused in the infamous Bhima Koregaon case that is about social activists’ alleged connections with the insurrectionary Maoists and their attempt to incite violence have been targeted through the Pegasus spyware and incriminating documents falsely implanted in their computers. Prior to Bhima Koregaon, there was an indiscriminate accusation of students, journalists and activists who opposed the current regime branded as ‘urban naxals’. It essentially meant they were all rebels working in urban areas and universities masquerading as activists and professionals. There were organised events of violence in course of elections in the capital city of Delhi and Jawaharlal Nehru University, apart from lawless vigilante groups indulging in mob lynching meant to create spectacles of fear and violence that were regularly with impunity beamed on television sets in drawing rooms.While the intent of all this is clear, the effect of it is not. Fear refuses to settle and take a vice-like grip over the imagination of the citizenry. While one cannot deny hushed up talks, activists and others taking precautions, using coded language on social media and common people refusing to speak up openly as they often did. The symptoms of fear are visible but the kind of condensation necessary in creating a closed and totalitarian society is not being manufactured. It could well be read as being momentary, but it somehow does not seem to enter popular imagination. It is not uncommon for people to openly talk about alleged conspiracies and express their opinion about them. There are intense moments of fear, but it somehow does not seem to take an institutionalised form where public activity is primarily guided by fear.One needs to look closely at the possible reasons to make sense of the future of Indian democracy.First, fear, possibly, fails to settle among activists and communities as a lot of activism and issues being addressed are localised in India. India continues to be provincial, and the ‘imagined community’ of a nation is often made sense through local imageries and imagination. Community bonding, caste-based solidarities, regional and linguistic affiliations here work as a solid bedrock of support and inspiration. Fear that is externally imposed is sought to be resisted by entrenched localism. Noted historian Romila Thapar in her recent book Voices of Dissent, succinctly observes that India was a civilization of dissent, and it is marked by heterogeneity and religious identities were marked by diverse localised sects than homogeneous unification.Second, governance in India is run not by institutions and laws but by individuals. Institutions and procedures are fairly supple and vulnerable. There is no embedded legal or Constitutional imagination or morality. These can be easily bypassed and violated without much public rancour. It is in fact considered to be a common-sense that that is how institutions work or ‘meant to work’. It has been easy for the current regime of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to subvert laws and occupy institutions. There has been very little resistance by officials in the name of the sacrality of rules. In conditions of intimidation and fear, they crumbled without a whimper of resistance. But what keeps democracy going and attempts of instilling fear challenged is the phenomenon of ‘conscientious individuals’ in public life.is ironic that for a communitarian society, it is individual actions that stand out. Universities, the world of journalism, judiciary, bureaucracy, apart from social activism are marked by such exceptional individuals who are prepared to work in face of every kind of hardship, including death. Even the threat of physical intimidation and elimination does not budge such individuals to compromise what they believe in. It is their presence that disallows fear to become the norm and State often falters in dealing with them. The intimidation that it wishes to create through arbitrariness, impunity and the use of exceptional laws becomes a matter of public reasoning and debate.Third, India’s modernity precariously balances the relation between politics and cultural life. Politics is often gauged by cultural symbolism and also reduced to an uneventful exclusivity. In other words, politics become central to people’s lifeworld through culture and politics in itself becomes a matter of banal routine or even a matter of indifference, notwithstanding the high emotions it invites. Behind the visible emotions, politics is seen with a sense of disdain and equated with instrumental reasoning, while culture is considered in the popular imagination to do with universal concerns.One could even call it ‘informed indifference’, where the idea that State can become omnipotent simply does not seem to exist. It creates an intriguing condition where even if the State has become authoritarian it is seen and received with a degree of indifference. We might have conditions of a totalitarian state spying but the chilling effect it wishes to create is lost on its people. State in India, therefore, has to not only impose exceptionalism but has to inform its citizens that it is becoming lawless but with impunity and there is no case here to either hide or justify the lawlessness (to draw an analogy in a lighter vein, it reminds me of a heatwave in London, where it was needed to not only announce but remind people to drink water !).Finally, fear as an external factor is difficult to impose because violence is routinised in India. I had in my earlier writings referred to India as a ‘violent democracy’ because violence is so complete that it is almost invisible. Brutalised conditions of existence that includes in rural hinterlands tremendous amounts of sexual violence against women, conditions of dispossession, bonded and child labour, hunger and more recently farmer suicides, apart from everyday caste-based violence being rampant. Fear becomes a non-event, as people cannot differentiate Statist violence as something being different but it is seen as part of the everyday normal.India’s independence is marked by an absence of freedom for swathes of its dispossessed population but that in itself creates a situation where fear cannot be an exclusive state project. How this will span out for Indian democracy in days to come has to be discussed at a future occasion. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/12/effective-deployable-accountable-pick-two-regulating-lethal-autonomous-weapons-system/,"‘Effective, Deployable, Accountable: Pick Two’: Regulating Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems",John Williams,Aug 12 2021,"Almost every keen cyclist knows pioneering US engineer Keith Bontrager’s famous observation about bicycles: ‘strong, light, cheap: pick two. If they don’t know it, they’ve experienced its effects at their local bike shop’s checkout when they upgrade any components. The current state of regulatory debate about Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) looks to be increasingly locked into a similar two-fold choice from three desirable criteria: ‘effective, deployable, accountable: pick two’. However, unlike Bontrager’s bicycles, where the conundrum reflects engineering and material facts, the regulatory debate entrenches social-structural ‘facts’ that make this two-from-three appear inescapable. This article explains how the structure of the LAWS regulatory debate is creating a two-from-three choice, and why the one that holds the most potential for containing the dangers LAWS may create – accountability – looks least likely to prevail. Effective and deployable, just like strong and light amongst cycling enthusiasts, are likely to win out. It won’t just be bank balances that ‘take the hit’ in this case, but, potentially, the bodies of our fellow human beings.Two key assumptions underpin my claim about an increasingly rigid debate over LAWS regulation. Firstly, LAWS are a realistic prospect for the relatively near-term future. Weapons systems that, once activated, are able to identify, select and engage targets without further human involvement have been around for at least forty years, in the form of systems that target incoming missiles or other ordnance (e.g. Williams 2015, 180). Systems such as Phalanx, C-RAM, Patriot, and Iron Dome are good examples of such systems. These are relatively uncontroversial because their programming operates within strictly defined parameters, which the systems themselves cannot change, and targeting ordnance typically raises few legal and ethical issues (for critical discussion see Bode and Watts 2021, 27-8). LAWS, as I am discussing them here, move outside this framework. Existing and foreseeable AI capabilities, eventually including techniques such as machine learning through deep neural networks, mean LAWS may make decisions within far more complex operational environments, learn from those decisions and their consequences, and, potentially, adjust their coding to ‘improve’ future performance (e.g. Sparrow 2007; Human Rights Watch 2012, 6-20; Roff 2016). Those sorts of capabilities, combined with advanced robotics and state-of-the-art weapons systems point towards LAWS not just to defend against incoming ordnance, but, frequently in conjunction with human combatants, to engage in complex operations including lethal targeting of humans. That targeting may include LAWS that directly apply kinetic effect against their targets – the ‘killer robots’ of sci-fi and popular imagination – but can also extend to include systems where AI and robotic functions provide mission-critical and integrated support functions in systems and ‘systems of systems where a human-operated weapon is a final element.Secondly, I assume efforts to ban the development and deployment of LAWS will fail. Despite a large coalition of NGOs, academics, policymakers, scientists, and others (e.g. ICRAC, iPRAW, Future of Life Institute 2015) LAWS development is more likely than not. Amandeep Singh Gill (2019, 175), former Indian Ambassador to the UN Conference on Disarmament and former Chair of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on LAWS at the UN Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), stresses how:The economic, political and security drivers for mainstreaming this suite of technologies [AI] into security functions are simply too powerful to be rolled back. There will be plenty of persuasive national security applications – minimizing casualties and collateral damage …, defeating terrorist threats, saving on defense spending, and protecting soldiers and their bases – to provide counterarguments against concerns about runaway robots or accidental wars caused by machine error.Appeals to the inherent immorality of allowing computers to make life and death decisions about human beings, often framed in terms of human dignity (e.g. Horowitz 2016; Heyns 2017; Rosert and Sauer 2019), will fall in the face of ostensibly unstoppable forces across multiple sectors making incorporating AI into ever more aspect of our daily lives almost inevitable. From ‘surveillance capitalism’ (Zuboff 2019) to LAWS, human beings are struggling to find ways to effectively halt, or even dramatically slow, AI’s march (e.g. Rosert and Sauer 2021).potential military effectiveness manifests at strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Operating at ‘machine speed’ means potentially outpacing adversaries and acquiring crucial advantages, it enables far faster processing of huge quantities of data to generate new insights and spot opportunities, and it means concentrating military effect with greater pace and accuracy (e.g. Altmann and Sauer 2017; Horowitz 2019; Jensen et al 2020). Shifts, even temporary, in delicate strategic balances between rival powers may appear as unacceptable risks, meaning that for as long as adversaries are interested in and pursuing this technology, their peer-rivals will feel compelled to do so too (e.g. Maas 2019, 141-43). Altmann and Sauer (2017, 124) note, ‘operational speed will reign supreme’. The ‘security dilemma’ looms large, reinforcing amongst leading states the sense they dare not risk being left behind in the competition to research and develop LAWS (e.g. Altmann and Sauer 2017; Scharre 2021). Morgan et al (2020, xvi) argue the US, for example, has no choice but to, ‘… stay at the forefront of military AI capability. … [N]ot to compete in an area where adversaries are developing dangerous capabilities is to cede the field. That would be unacceptable’. Things likely look the same in Moscow and Beijing. Add concerns about potential proliferation to non-state actors (e.g. Dunn 2015), and the security dilemma’s powerful logic appears inescapable.Of course, other weapons technologies inspired similar proliferation, strategic destabilization, and conflict escalation concerns. Arms control – a key focus for current regulatory debate – has slowed the spread of nuclear weapons, banned chemical and biological weapons, and prohibited blinding laser weapons before they were ever deployed (e.g. Baker et al 2020). International regulation can alter the strategic calculus about what weapons do and do not appear effective and persuade actors to deny themselves the systems in the first place, or limit their acquisition and deployment, or give them up as part of a wider deal that offers a better route to strategic stability. LAWS present specific arms control challenges because they incorporate AI and robotics technologies offering many non-military opportunities and advantages that human societies will want to pursue, potentially bringing major benefits in addressing challenges in diverse fields. Key breakthroughs are at least as likely to come from civilian research and development projects as from principally military ones. That makes definitions, monitoring, and verification harder. That is not a reason not to try, of course, but it does mean effective LAWS may take many forms, incorporate inherently hard to restrict technologies, and offer possibly irresistible benefits in what the security dilemma presents as an inescapably competitive, militarized, and uncertain international environment (e.g. Sparrow 2009; Altmann 2013; Williams 2015; Garcia 2018; Gill 2019).Combining with the idea of the inescapable security dilemma are ideas about the unchanging ‘nature’ of warfare. Rooted in near-caricatured Clausewitzian thought, war’s unchanging nature is the application of force to compel an opponent to do our will and in pursuit of political goals to which war contributes as the continuation of policy by other means (Jensen et al 2020). To reject, challenge, or misunderstand this, in some eyes, calls into question the credibility of any critic of military technological development (e.g. Lushenko 2020, 78-9). War’s ‘character’, however, may transform, including through technological innovation, summarised in the idea of ‘revolutions in military affairs’. In this framing, LAWS represent the latest and next steps in a computer-based RMA that can trace its origins to the Vietnam War, and which war’s nature makes impossible to stop, let alone reverse. The effectiveness of LAWS is therefore judged in part against a second fixed and immutable reference point – the nature of war – that means technological innovations changing war’s character must be pursued. Failing to recognise such changes risks the age-old fate of those who took on up-to-date military powers with outmoded principles, technologies, or tactics.DeployableDeployable systems face the challenge of operating alongside human military personnel and within complex military structures and processes where human involvement looks set to continue well beyond plausibly foreseeable technological developments. AI already plays support roles in the complex systems behind familiar remotely piloted aerial systems (RPAS, or ‘drones’) frequently used for targeted killing and close air support operations such as Reaper. This is principally in the bulk analysis of massive quantities of intelligence data collected by these, and other Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platforms and through other intelligence gathering techniques, such as data and communications intercepts.Envisaged deployable systems offering meaningful tactical advantages could take several forms. Increasingly AI-enabled and sophisticated versions of current unmanned aerial systems (UAS) providing close air support for deployed ground forces, or surveillance and strike functions in counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations are one example. That could extend into air combat roles. Ground and sea-based versions of these sorts of platforms exist to some extent and the same kind of advantages appeal in those environments, such as persistent presence, long duration, speed of operation, and the potential to deploy into environments too dangerous for human personnel. More radical, and further into the future, are ‘swarming’ drones utilizing ‘hive’ AI distributed across hundreds or possibly thousands of small, individually dispensable units that disperse and then concentrate at critical moments to swamp defences and destroy targets (e.g. Sanders 2017). Operating in distinct spaces from human forces (except for those they are unleashed against), such swarms could create chances for novel military tactics impossible when having to deploy human beings, placing human-only armed forces at critical disadvantages. Those sorts of systems potentially transform tactical innovation and operational speed into strategic advantage.Safely deploying LAWS alongside human combatants presents serious trust challenges. Training and other procedures to integrate AI into combat roles will have to be carefully designed and thoroughly tested if humans are to trust LAWS (Roff and Danks 2018). New mechanisms must ensure human combatants are appropriately sceptical of LAWS’ decisions, backed by the capability to intervene to override, re-direct, or shutdown LAWS operating irrationality or dangerously. Bode and Watts (2021) highlight challenges this creates even for extant systems, such as Close-in Weapons Systems and Air Defence Systems, where human operators typically lack key knowledge and understanding of systems’ design and operational parameters to exercise appropriate scepticism in the face of seemingly counterproductive or counter-factual actions and recommendations. As systems gain AI power that gap likelysystems that can work alongside human combatants to enhance their lethal application of kinetic force, in environments where humans are present, and where principles of discrimination and proportionality apply present major challenges. Such systems will need to square the circle of offering the tactical and operational advantages LAWS promise whilst being sufficiently comprehensible to humans that they can interact with them effectively, to build relationships of trust. That suggests systems with specific, limited roles and carefully defined functionality. That may make such systems cheaper and faster to make, more easily maintained, with adaptations, upgrades, and replacements more straightforward. There could be little need to keep expensive, ageing platforms serviceable and up-to-date, as we see with current manned aircraft, for example, where 30+ year service lives are now common, with some airframes still flying more than fifty years after entering service. You also don’t need to pay LAWS a pension. This could make LAWS more appealing and accessible to smaller state powers and non-state actors, driving proliferation concerns (e.g. Dunn 2015).This account of deployable systems, however, reiterates the complexity of conceptualising LAWS: when does autonomous AI functionality turn the whole system into a LAWS? AI-human interfaces may develop to the point where ‘Centaur’ warfare (e.g. Roff and Danks 2018, 8), with humans and LAWS operating in close coordination alongside one another, or ‘posthuman’ or ‘cyborg’ systems directly embedding AI functionality into humans (e.g. Jones 2018) become possible. Then the common assumption in legal regulatory debates that LAWS will be distinct from humans (e.g. Liu 2019, 104) will blur further or disappear entirely. Deployable LAWS functioning in Centaur-like symbiosis with human team members or cyborg-like systems could be highly effective, but they further complicate an already challenging accountability puzzle.deployed systems (albeit in ‘back office’ or very specific roles), and near-future systems reinforce claims to operational and tactical speed advantages. However, prosecuting and punishing machines that go wrong and commit crimes makes little, if any, sense (e.g. Sparrow 2007, 71-3). Where, amongst humans, accountability lies and how it is enforced is contentious. Accountability debates have increasingly focused on retaining ‘meaningful human control’ (MHC) (Various formulations of ‘X Human Y’ exist in this debate, but are all sufficiently similar to be treated together here. See Morgan et al 2020, 43 and McDougall 2019, 62-3 for details). Ideally, accountability should both ensure systems are as safe for humans as possible (those they are used against, as well as those they operate alongside or defend), and enable misuse and the inevitable errors that come with using complex technologies to be meaningfully addressed. Bode and Watts (2021) contest the extent to which MHC exists in relation to current, very specific, LAWS, and are consequently sceptical that the concept can meet the challenges of future LAWS developments.The idea of an ‘accountability gap’ is widely discussed (e.g. Sparrow 2007; Human Rights Watch 2012, 42-6; Human Rights Watch 2015; Heyns 2017; Robillard 2018; McDougall 2019). The gap ostensibly arises because of doubts over whether humans can be held reasonably and realistically accountable for the actions of LAWS, when those actions breach relevant legal or ethical codes. MHC is a way to close any accountability gap, and takes many potential forms. The most commonly discussed are:Direct human authorisation for using force against humans (‘in the loop’ control).Active, real-time human monitoring of systems with the ability to intervene in case of malfunction or behaviour that departs from human-defined standards (‘on the loop’ monitoring).Command responsibility such that those authorising LAWS’ deployments are accountable for whatever they do, potentially to a standard of strict liability.Weapon development, review and testing processes such that design failures or software faults could provide a basis for human accountability, in this case extending to engineers and manufacturers.International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is central to most academic analysis, policy debates and regulatory proposals in the CCW GGE, which has discussed this over a number of years (e.g. Canberra Working Group 2020). However, novel legal means, such as ‘war torts’ (Crootof 2016) whereby civil litigation could be brought against humans or corporate bodies for the damages arising from LAWS failures and errors also appear in debate.Whilst some state delegations to the CCW GGE, such as the UK, argue current IHL is adequate to deal with LAWS, a significant minority have pushed for a ban on LAWS, citing the inadequacy of current legal regulation and the risks of destabilisation. The most common position favours close monitoring of LAWS developments or, potentially, a moratorium. Any future systems must meet existing IHL obligations and be capable of discriminate and proportionate the use of force (for a summary of state positions see Human Rights Watch 2020). In parallel, new legal and treaty-based regulatory structures, with IHL as the critical reference point to ensure human accountability, should be developed (GGE Chairperson’s Summary 2020). That policy stance implicitly accepts the accountability gap exists and must be filled if LAWS are to be a legitimate component of future arsenals (for details of state positions at the CCW GGE see Human Rights WatchThis picture of effective and deployable systems highlights their compatibility and reflects the position found across a broad spectrum of accounts of the military and security literature on LAWS. Accountability turns this into a Bontragerian two-from-three.Deployable and accountable LAWS would likely be ineffective. Retaining ‘in the loop’ control as the surest way of enabling accountability precludes systems offering the transformation to ‘machine speed’. ‘On the loop’ monitoring allows more leeway for speed, but if that monitoring is to retain MHC via human interventions to stop malfunctioning or misbehaving systems before they do serious harm, it only loosens the reins a little. The other options all create post facto accountability for harm that has already occurred, rather than stopping it from happening in the first place, so are inherently second best. All look likely to lead to complex, long-running processes to assess the location, extent, and nature of responsibility and then to apportion appropriate blame and dispense punishment and/or award compensation to humans already substantially harmed. Years of investigation, litigation, appeals, and political and institutional foot-dragging seem highly likely outcomes. Accountability delayed is accountability denied.Effective and accountable LAWS would be undeployable. Squaring the circle of machine speed effectiveness with human speed accountability (in whatever form that takes) appears daunting at best, impossible at worst (e.g. Sparrow 2007, 68-9), resulting in LAWS of such byzantine complexity or so compromised in functionality as to make them largely pointless additions to any military arsenal. Taking advantage of the strategic, operational, and tactical opportunities of LAWS looks likely to necessitate accepting a very greatly reduced level of accountability.ConclusionSo, which two to pick? The best answer here may be to return to the idea that, unlike making bicycles, this two-from-three challenge is not constrained by the brute facts of physical materials and engineering processes. The arguments for effective and deployable systems appeal to material-like arguments via the ostensibly inescapable structural pressures of the security dilemma and the military necessity for maximising speed in the exploitation of operational and tactical advantage given war’s immutable ‘nature’ but changing ‘character’. Adversaries, especially those less likely to be concerned about accountability in the first place (e.g. Dunn 2015; Harari 2018; Morgan et al 2020, xiv, xv, xvii, 27) may gain more effectiveness from more deployable systems. The supposedly inescapable security dilemma and speed-based logics of war bite again.LAWS regulation looks, at present, as though it may be an object lesson in the risks of seeing ideational social-structural phenomena as material and immutable. Escaping ‘effective, deployable, accountable: pick two’, requires a major change in the perspectives on the nature of the international system and war’s place within it amongst political and military leaders, especially those in states such as the US, Russia, and China at the forefront of LAWS research and development. There seems a very limited reason for optimism about that, meaning that the regulatory challenge of LAWS looks, at best, to be about harm reduction from the development and deployment of LAWS through creating incentives to try and establish a culture of IHL compliance in design and development of LAWS (e.g. Scharre 2021). More far-reaching and radical change to the LAWS debate potentially involves some quite fundamental re-thinking of the nature of the debate, the reference points used (e.g. Williams 2021), and, first and foremost, a willingness to break free from the ostensibly material and hence inescapable pressures of the nature of war and the securityAltmann, J.

In Aquinas’ Summa, each “article” reflects this basic approach, with each section of the article having the same basic structure and opening with its own distinctive opening phrase that reveals its specific purpose within the text. of sense, for he is concerned not merely with informing his readers, but also with teaching them the proper method for thinking through an issue – one that forces them to give serious consideration to alternative perspectives before arriving at a reasoned conclusion.The structure is outlined as follows:“It seems that….” – First, Aquinas states the position he will end up disagreeing with, and then gives what he thinks are the three best arguments in favor of that position. “On the contrary….” – Second, Aquinas articulates his own position, typically citing some authoritative text in support of his position.“I answer that” – Third, Aquinas lays out the argument in favor of his own position.“Reply to….” – Finally, Aquinas rebuts each of the counter-arguments to his own position as presented in the first part of the article.QuestionArticle 1: Will the accelerating growth in China’s power, increasingly harnessed to the goals explicit and implicit in President Xi Jingping’s “China Dream”, result in a systemic or world war with the United States?#1: To be sure, the rise of the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC) as an economic, diplomatic, and military power – a dynamic focused and amplified by Xi Jinping’s ambitious vision of a rejuvenated China – does raise the very real possibility that the PRC will (or at least will attempt to) displace the United States (US) as global hegemon or predominant political, economic, and military state within the international system. And in the past, it has been more common than not that the rise of an active challenger to the dominant or status quo power at has been strongly correlated with what scholars refer to as “hegemonic war” – that is, a system-wide war over the very nature and governance of the international order. Indeed, some scholars now refer to this phenomenon as the “Thucydides Trap”, after Thucydides’ account of the way in which Athens’ rise threatened Spartan hegemony, trapping both powers in a dynamic leading inexorably to the Peloponnesian War. However, in the US/PRC case the likelihood of such a war is in fact vanishingly small due to the incontrovertible fact that these two powers are enmeshed in web of economic relations that is without precedent in the long history of hegemonic rivalry stretching back at least as far as Thucydides’ time. Simply put, these two countries share what is in effect a single economy. This interdependence mitigates the possibility of hegemonic war in that it makes war far too costly for either power to seriously consider. In such a war, there could simply be no winners – only losers. This makes war an irrational, perhaps even unthinkable, option.And as for the Thucydides Trap, history teaches us that it is far from being inescapable. While it is true that the rise of Athens that precipitated the Peloponnesian War, it is also true that the rise of Spain in the late-15th century did not trigger a war with hegemonic Portugal; nor did the rise of the US in the early 20th century spark a war with hegemonic Britain. Nor, significantly, did the four-decade long “twilight struggle” between the US and USSR result in anything even remotely like a hegemonic war. Now the international realm is without question one of uncertainty – what Clausewitz called the “fog of war” shrouds not only the battlefield in time of armed conflict, but the entire terrain of international relations even in times of peace (Carl von Clausewitz, Vom Kriege, Book 1, Chapter 3). And it is also true, as the Second Vatican Council noted, “insofar as men are sinful, the threat of war hangs over them, and hang over them it will until the return of Christ” (Gaudium et Spes 78). While war due to misperception, miscalculation, miscommunication, or even our post-Lapsarian human nature remains an ever-present possibility, in this case the economic costs of war, and the obvious benefits to both countries of some form of what St. Augustine called tranquilitas ordinis, strongly favor the continued peaceful rise of China – even if that rise ultimately leads to the PRC displacing the US as global hegemon. Therefore, there will be no hegemonic war between the world’s two largest economies and two most powerful states.Objection #2: Further, unlike in most of the past cases of hegemonic war, the current geopolitical situation is pregnant with the possibility that the human race might extinguish itself. Today, any such systemic or total war would inevitably involve the use of nuclear weapons – which the US possesses in abundance and China is acquiring at an accelerating rate – either as a result of strategic calculation on the part of one or both of the powers or alternatively as the tragic outcome of unintended escalation.Either way, war between these two powers would necessarily result in unprecedented – even unimaginable – death and destruction being visited on both countries. All of this dramatically changes the cost-benefit calculus of any aspiring hegemon that might wish to advance its ambitions by launching a nuclear coup de main – not to mention those of any existing hegemon that might consider launching a nuclear strike to pre-empt an aspiring challenger. Indeed, the reality of Mutually Assured Destruction is more likely to induce Mutually Assured Caution – that is, self-restraint to the point where neither power would countenance any use of military force for fear that it might lead to a catastrophic, even suicidal, war. Therefore, there will be no hegemonic war between two of the world’s most powerful, nuclear armed#3: Finally, the PRC does not need to formally assume the mantle of global hegemon in order to realize Xi Jinping’s admittedly ambitious “China Dream” – a dream that imagines a future China as an influential, perhaps even predominant, power on the world stage. These goals can all be achieved without the need for some sort of military preponderance or coercive domination. Indeed, as China’s leaders over the past few generations have learned, and as the current CCP leadership surely understands, the PRC can flourish as a global Great Power – and perhaps even as a dominant regional power – without assuming the costs or responsibilities of global hegemony. Specifically, they view this goal as being achievable through economic, diplomatic, and other “soft power” initiatives (like the so-called “Belt-and-Road Initiative”). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that the pursuit of Xi Jinping’s “China Dream” will result in either a sustained Chinese bid to displace the US as global hegemon or a calculated campaign of Chinese regional brinkmanship that might inadvertently precipitate a major war with the US.ThesisOn the contrary, in the same way that “the rise of Athens and the fear that this instilled in Sparta… made war inevitable,” so too the rise of China will instill fear in the United States, driving great power competition and making war between these two powers inevitable as well.Arguments in Favor of the thesisI answer that, if the current trend-lines concerning the development of Chinese and US comprehensive national power (i.e. power in its economic, diplomatic, institutional, and military forms) are projected out a decade or so, they will intersect. When this happens, history dictates that, absent certain highly atypical mitigating circumstances, an armed conflict is destined to erupt between these two powers. Such mitigating circumstances, history teaches us, include mutual exhaustion as a result of other conflicts (as in the Portuguese/Spanish case), and a disposition on the part of a declining hegemon to accommodate a rising one (on the basis of shared values and interests, as in the UK/US case). Perhaps obviously, none of these mitigating conditions obtains in the contemporary case.Given the prospect that such a conflict has the potential to be catastrophically counter-productive for all involved, it may well be the case that both of the principals will limit the types of weapons employed (use of nuclear weapons, for example, will be eschewed), their targets (large civilian centers will not be attacked), and perhaps even their operating environments (space, it is reasonable to assume, will be off limits). This being said, all other types or weapons (hypersonic cruise missiles and anti-ship ballistic missiles, for example) and operational concepts (hybrid war and cyber-war, to take but two obvious examples) will likely be employed à l’outrance.Thus whatever the limits with respect to means, it is highly unlikely that the stakes of the looming Sino-American war will be limited in any meaningful way: this will be a struggle for mastery of the globe in which only one power (and perhaps, in a worst-case scenario, neither power) will prevail. There is nothing to suggest that once the trend-lines intersect, the US will peacefully accommodate the PRC’s attempt to usurp the mantle of global leadership.I concede the following points to those who assert that the Thucydides Trap is escapable. First, the trap may be avoided if the US acts now with prudence, fortitude and strategic skill it may be able to dissuade the PRC from aggressively seeking to realize its hegemonic aspirations. This might include taking steps to bend either the US or Chinese trend lines in ways favorable to the status quo, containing or rolling back Chinese efforts to position itself favorably for a bid for hegemony, and/or rallying the international community in support of US leadership and in opposition to China’s bid for global hegemony. Second, it is also possible that the Trap may be escaped if there is a change of regime, or a change in regime leadership, in the PRC. Finally, the trap may not spring if China’s economic growth peaks well short of overtaking that of thefollows from all this that the recent and accelerating growth in China’s comprehensive national power, increasingly harnessed to the hegemonic aspirations intrinsic to Xi Jinping’s “China Dream”, is likely to result in a systemic war with the US in the foreseeable future.Replies to objectionsReply to Objection 1: Economic interdependence was higher in Europe in 1914 than between the US and PRC today, a fact that didn’t prevent the rise of another aspiring hegemon seeking its “place in the sun” from triggering a catastrophic world war. To be sure, the literature dealing with the outbreak of the First World War is vast and varied. No one doubts, however, that whether the war was an accident (the world somehow “slithered over the brink into the boiling cauldron of war” in David Lloyd George’s felicitous phrase) or the result of Germany’s or Russia’s or some other power’s strategic (mis)calculation, it happened despite extensive and multi-dimensional (economic, social, and cultural) integration – indeed, it happened in the context of a degree of integration that was not reached again in Europe until recent decades.Extensive and deep economic integration – with all the associated mutual sensitivity and vulnerability that entails – is thus no prophylactic against systemic or hegemonic war.Reply to Objection 2: Given the degree to which still-raw memories of the recent Great War – coupled with fears of catastrophic destruction at the hands of massive fleets of strategic bombers –permeated popular, political, and military cultures during the interwar period, one might reasonably have expected that the prospect of a second world war would have been rendered simply unthinkable. And yet, just over two decades after the Armistice was signed in 1918 the world was at war again.Thus we must conclude that we cannot count on fear of death to deter or prevent the outbreak of war – even war that might involve the use of nuclear weapons, and even war that has the potential to trigger a planetary extinction event.Reply to Objection 3: The PRC may or may not need to displace the US and assume the mantle of global hegemony, but that is clearly and undeniably what the dominant faction within the CCP desires. Indeed, the CCP ruling clique more than simply desires such an outcome, it sees it as (a) absolutely necessary, (b) unquestionably foreordained, and (c) entirely right and just. In their mind, the necessity is a function of political logic: they need this victory over the Americans as a means of cementing fealty and homage to a regime that otherwise rests on increasingly wobbly foundations. China’s rulers see it as foreordained in that global domination is the natural and inevitable telos of China’s pre- and post-revolutionary history (the former a deeply embedded cultural disposition sometimes referred to as the “Middle Kingdom Syndrome”; the latter a function of Marxist-Leninist ideology and Xi’s revival of Mao Zedong Thought). And, perhaps most importantly, the CCP ruling clerisy believe it to be only right and just that China should reprise its historical role as the Middle Kingdom – that is, as the righteous center of the universe around which all other powers revolve, and the preeminent political power to which all others owe tribute and deference.Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that the PRC will continue, indeed intensify, its current strategic campaign to displace the United States as both the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific region and the hegemonic power on the world stage.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/10/opinion-discriminatory-ice-cream/,Opinion – Discriminatory Ice Cream?,Alexander Loengarov,Aug 10 2021,"Neither the Israeli government nor the US administration, which both took up office during the first half of 2021, seemed to place the Israeli-Palestinian conflict front and center in their policy agenda. Now a trivial yet (for many) essential staple has brought it back to the focus of public and social debate. On 19 July 2021, ice cream producer Ben & Jerry’s, which sells its products in about 40 countries worldwide, announced through a pithy statement on its website that it ‘will not renew the license agreement’ with its Israeli manufacturer in Be’er Tuvya ‘when it expires at the end of next year’. According to the statement, the company is looking to continue ice cream sales in Israel but not in Israeli settlements in ‘Occupied Palestinian Territory’.It did not take long for controversy to break out. That same evening, a commentator in the Israeli public broadcaster’s news studio linked the decision to Ben & Jerry’s ‘progressive’ Jewish founders from Vermont and recalled US senator Bernie Sanders hails from the same state. Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett expressed his dismay in a conversation with the CEO of Ben & Jerry’s parent company Unilever, while Israel’s ambassador to the US and the UN reached out to governors of 35 US states that have legislation discouraging business with companies involved in boycotts of Israel. And the Israeli Minister of the Economy posted a TikTok video in which she, after hearing the radio news on her way home, ostensibly swirls her Ben & Jerry’s ice cream from the freezer into the trash.The announcement was thus clearly seen as anti-Israel, although it concerns – in its present form – Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which constitute a territory with unclear status, even under Israeli law. Indeed, Israel partly applied its law to the settlements, but the latter’s territory has not been annexed to Israel, contrary to what was set out in the 2020 Trump plan and the previous Israeli government’s coalition agreement. Internationally, no other country considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank as part of Israel.In itself, a company’s choice to sell products in a given country and not in others is not exceptional. Also, in the announcement on its website, Ben & Jerry’s has not signaled an intention to pull out from Israel. As such, the contentious decision is therefore not automatically anti-Israeli, let alone antisemitic, as former Israeli minister Eli Cohen claimed the next day. Rather, it confronts Israel with the long-standing fact that its eastern border is not clearly defined, in the first place not by itself. Pointing that out does not necessarily mean taking a stance on the future of the West Bank, and even less so amounts to calling for discrimination or a boycott of Israel.However, one would be remiss to be blind for the larger context of Ben & Jerry’s decision. The ice cream producer has been part of the multinational Unilever since 2000, albeit by a singular agreement under which Ben & Jerry’s is given an independent board that can devise its own company policy. Therefore, it has been able to market its icy treats to a specific public that, states and worldwide, is concerned with typically left-wing causes like social rights, racial justice and environmental sustainability. For a large part of that constituency, the Palestinian issue is another top-rank concern: for many years, Ben & Jerry’s has been pressured to change its policies with regard to selling to the Israelirub here is that part of this constituency and part of the lobby groups seem to hold views that amount to denying Israel’s legitimacy altogether, as is for instance apparent from a statement in which ‘Vermonters for Justice in Palestine’ continues to call for an end to all marketing and sales of Ben & Jerry’s products in Israel.For anyone dealing with these matters, it is good to realize the context in which decisions like Ben & Jerry’s are perceived. Indeed, from the early history of the state of Israel (and, further back in time, of Jewish populations) through the present day, the Jewish-Israeli public has felt under attack, to different degrees but also in different ways (militarily, economically, diplomatically). Regardless of one’s own views on the matter, it is hard to minimize its psychological effect and needs to be taken into account to understand the full picture and work towards solving issues like these.NB: “This present opinion piece reflects solely its author’s views and not those of the European Economic and Social Committee or the European Union.” "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/06/opinion-a-feminist-foreign-policy-for-india-where-to-turn/,Opinion – A Feminist Foreign Policy for India: Where to Turn?,Khushi Singh Rathore,Aug 6 2021,"‘If domination and inequality are to be ended, the root cause of these have to be identified and eliminated so that India and other countries can live in security, and plan for progress and peace…there is a concept of a model society and model world order which we are aiming at, and in this, national and international…are not separable’ (C. B Muthamma 1988). Sweden was the first country to have adopted a Feminist Foreign Policy (FFP) in 2014. Next, Canada (2017) formulated its feminist international assistance policy focused on gender equality and promoting the safety of women and girls in its foreign aid assistance. Soon after, the Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs announced the development of a feminist foreign policy white paper. In 2019 France declared its intent to develop a feminist foreign policy framework. Recently, Mexico became the first Latin American and Global South country to adopt FFP explicitly.Margot Wallström, the former Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs, defined Sweden’s FFP as ‘standing against the systematic and global subordination of women and a “precondition” for achieving Sweden’s wider foreign development and security policy objectives.’ The Centre for Feminist Foreign Policy (CFFP) defines it as a ‘political framework’ focused on ‘the wellbeing of marginalized people and invokes processes of self-reflection regarding foreign policy’s hierarchical global systems’. FFP goes beyond the conventional conceptualization of foreign policy thinking and opens the ‘black box’ by offering an intersectional approach towards security ‘from the viewpoint of the most vulnerable’. CFFP explains it to be a multidimensional policy framework, aiming at elevating the experiences and agency of women and marginalized communities ‘to scrutinize the destructive forces of patriarchy, colonization, heteronormativity, capitalism, racism, imperialism, and militarism’.To sum it up, it would be correct to say that, in theory, FFP is an approach to foreign policy thought and practice committed to gender justice and equality and is rooted in humanitarian principles, consistently working towards dismantling all oppressive structures that dictate world politics. It is an approach that does not merely talk about ‘adding women’; instead, it works towards ensuring substantive changes in the hierarchical world of international relations at the most fundamental level. Thus, FFP aspires to build a better, more equal and just world.The discourse on the FFP agenda is often begins with the legacy of UNSCR 1325, and rightly so, in the feminist imagination of the foreign policy approach and the resultant push for the leap already taken by a few countries in that direction. However, one cannot overlook that while the phrase ‘gender sensitive’ still makes it to the realms of foreign policymaking, ‘feminisms’ continue to unsettle most sitting in the high corridors of power. Thus, there is still a long way to go.The discourse on feminist foreign policy for India is a work in progress, with most scholars very aptly highlighting the moral and strategic advantage of such a push for India. With its skewed sex ratio and a rising crime against women (National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) notes that on average, India recorded 87 rape cases daily in 2019, a 7% rise from 2018) & 140th place, 28 places down from its previous ranking, in the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Report, the adoption of a feminist approach in all spheres of politics comes to be the most logical course for the country; India would also benefit internationally with active advocacy for equal representation for women. Latter is a tricky slope though and one warranting caution seeing the current state of Indianfar, India’s commitment to a ‘gender-sensitive foreign policy’ has been primarily outward-looking. It has advocated atinternational forums for goals that resonate with UNSCR 1325 & WPS agenda ideals, efforts mainly situated under the paradigm of peacekeeping and development assistance. However, it has refrained from adopting a WPS National Action Plan (NAP) to date. Despite ratifying the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) (1979), it has also not ratified the Optional Protocol that allows women to directly approach the CEDAW committee in case the domestic state apparatus fails in aiding justice.Soumita Basu argues that ‘gender matters in international affairs, in words if not always in deeds’. Thus, it is imperative for the push for a feminist foreign policy for India, albeit its currency in the international forum, to not unintentionally reduce the Indian version of FFP to mere outward inclusion of ‘gender’ in the lexicon without commitment to a domestic allegiance to the feminist way ahead. Therefore, one asks, can there be a feminist foreign policy without commitment to feminist governance? I would say no. FFP is not merely about adding women; it has to be an overhaul in the political outlook and culture by incorporating transformative principles of feminism.The question then is, where does India turn for a roadmap to FFP? A conventional argument would be to look at the countries that have already adopted FFP that could inspire others on their path of a feminist turn in their dealing with the world. Though well placed, absolute reliance on this tangent of thought runs the risk of such a discourse giving an impression that FFP is a phenomenon that has developed in its entirety in the global North. While it is true that the explicit policy framework and the term FFP was born in the developed countries of the West, one has to dig deeper and ask whether the ethos and core tenets of FFP are really that new to the non-Western post-colonial states?Reflecting on the early political history of independent India, Swati Parashar brings to our attention how Indian history presents one with shades and ‘elements of gender-sensitive foreign policy and what is effectively being called feminist foreign policy’ today. She also cautions that this is not to say that these tenets were deliberately conceptualized with feminist ideals in mind or that gender equality was a core aim of these. However, it is the synergy between the vision of an independent India for itself in the world and how that is reflected in its foreign policy outlook.Throwing light on the convergences in the journey of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and women’s movement, Devaki Jain and Shubha Chacko write:A cursory glance at the history of the NAM reveals that the basic elements that informed its approach to international issues included the right of independent judgement, the struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism, and moderation in relations with all big powers. Rather than passive neutrality or isolationist policy of non-involvement in all conflicts, it was an assertion of agency on the part of Third World nations that was considered the hallmark of being ‘sovereign’ and ‘independent’.They further elucidate how the underlying principles informing feminist discourse and praxis, and the NAM conferences and declarations can be found in the ‘idea of self-determination’ of those vulnerable and often bereft of power. This definition reads closely to the present-day parameters of FFP as mentioned above, with the fundamental values of both non-alignment and FFP premised in the tenets of justice, equality, solidarity and peace.Then, is a FFP framework unimaginable or alien to India with its rich anticolonial past and history of women’s movements? I would say, not really. Instead, I argue that in the anticolonial thinking and revolutionary women’s international thought, one can trace the values that come to be defined today as FFP. Countries like India have to look at their past, even before the moment of non-alignment, study the visions of the ‘one world’ that marked their initiation into the post-WWII world stage. In this decolonial vision, one should look for the inspiration for feminist foreign policy, especially in women’s history that is more often than not rendered subservient to chronicles of nationalism in South Asian historiography. In these terrains of forgotten international thought, one can find various forms of feminist consciousness rooted in anti-imperial political thought and an early blueprint that had the potential to transform into what is today called feminist foreignReading on E-International RelationsOpinion – #arrestlucknowgirl: A Reminder of India’s Postcolonial Desire to Control WomenIndia’s Daughter and the Limits of Transnational Feminist SolidarityConflict in Kashmir: From the Ground UpOpinion — Cloaked to Invisibility: Circular Migrants in IndiaThe Thatcherization of India’s Foreign PolicyString of Pearls: India and the Geopolitics of Chinese Foreign PolicyAbout The Author(s)Khushi Singh Rathore is a Doctoral Candidate in International Politics at the Centre for International Politics, Organization and Disarmament (CIPOD), School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/08/03/moldova-and-the-transnistria-conflict-still-a-regional-cold-war/,Moldova and the Transnistria Conflict: Still a Regional Cold War?,Martin Duffy,Aug 3 2021,"My recent visit to Moldova on behalf of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and ODIHR/OSCE allowed me to indulge interests first sparked by reading Zoran Nicolic’s Atlas of Unusual Borders. My fellow International Relations Studies colleagues will recall that the Transnistria War erupted in November 1990 involving pro-Transnistria (PMR) independence forces (Transnistrian Republican Guard, irregular militias, Cossack units, and Russian 14th Army), against pro-Moldovan forces (incorporating regular troops, police, and some irregulars) (Baban, 2015, 1-12). The worst of the fighting and forced migration occurred in March 1992. A ceasefire brokered in July 1992 has largely held as this “war by proxy” (with Russia allegedly defending its historic sphere of political influence over its former colony) has become one of Europe’s iciest of “cold conflicts” (Luhti, 2015, 3-8.)It is worth recalling that prior to the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina and the birth of the Moldavian SSR in 1940, Bessarabian Moldova (the territory west of the river Dniester (Nistru) had been part of Romania. Modern Moldova eventually re-discovered its modernity and reclaimed its territorial rights in its Declaration of Independence in 1991 (King, 1994, 345-368.)Sadly, and despite the fall of the Soviet Union, the territorial changes which split Transnistria from the rest of Moldova have remained in place.It is also important to note that before the Moldavian SSR, Transnistria was part of the Ukrainian SSR (Motyl, 1982, 62-78.)It boasted a (relatively) short-lived autonomous republic called the Moldovan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, with Tiraspol as its capital (1924–1940) and as today constituted about a tenth of Moldova’s total landmass (Ibid.) It is an archetypal double minority conflict. As the majority Moldovan community says, “we will never lose you Tiraspol…” and as Transnistria’s predominantly Russian residents chant, “Motherland Russia forever…” (Duffy, 2021, 67.) Visiting Tiraspol is a little like going back into Soviet time, as the political time-capsule, which is the Transnistrian conflict, has hermetically sealed this cold-war conflict and beautifully preserved a quintessentially Soviet out-station as if time stood still and its vintage CCCP clocks had abruptly stopped.Birth of Modern MoldovaMoldova was an early beneficiary of Mikhail Gorbachev’s policies of perestroika and glasnost, permitting political pluralism at the regional (republican) level (Buwoski et al., 2018). Then everything became unhinged across its most Russian-speaking territory. Loyalties were sorely divided, and old blood loyalties to the Russian motherland ran deep. In the Moldovan SSR, like many other parts of the Soviet Union, national movements proliferated (Ibid. 45-67.) In time, these forces enhanced underlying impulses to leave the USSR in favor of uniting with Romania. That spawned a counter-blast from the primarily Russian-speaking ethnic minorities who predominated in areas like Transnistria. The change was gradual but occasionally violent.In August 1989, the Supreme Soviet of the Moldavian SSR made Moldovan the official language, recognized a linguistic Moldavian-Romanian identity, and the Romanian Latin alphabet in the Moldovan language. In 1990, the words Soviet and Socialist were replaced with “Republic of Moldova” (Ibid., 40-51.) Transnistria, its strange breakaway status crystallized by the power struggles of an increasingly bipolar world order, malingered on with three solitary friends (apart, of course, from Big Uncle Moscow) – namely the three other mostly unrecognized breakaway states: Abkhazia, Artsakh, and Southtoppling of the Ceaușescu regime in Romania in December 1989 and re-opening the border between Romania and Moldova on 6 May 1990 led many in Transnistria and Moldova to believe that a union between Moldova and Romania was inevitable (Ibid., 45-56.) With the fall of Communist Party rule, Romania appeared much more attractive. This, unfortunately, alarmed the Russian-speaking population, spawned secessionist movements in Gagauzia and Transnistria, and as the nationalist-dominated Moldovan Supreme Soviet outlawed these initiatives, the Gagauz Republic and Transnistria declared independence from Moldova (Ibid., 46-56.) They sought re-alignment with the Soviet Union as independent federal republics, and of course, Moscow’s assistance was bountiful. Transnistria thus became one of numerous “unrecognised republics” in the USSR, alongside Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. These self-proclaimed states maintained close ties with each other and are mainly dependent on Russian sponsorship.Republic of MoldovaAfter the Soviet coup attempt of 1991, the Moldovan parliament adopted the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova. It sought to assert its sovereignty over the entire territory of the now-former MSSR (Haynes, 2020, 6-34.) Tensions erupted in Transnistria. On 5 April 1992, Vice-President Rutskoy of Russia told 5,000 people assembled in Tiraspol that “Transnistrians should demand independence” (Ibid.) The first fatalities in the emerging conflict occurred on 2 November 1990, two months after the PMR’s 2 September 1990 declaration of independence. Moldovan forces entered Dubăsari to separate Transnistria into two halves but were stopped by the city’s inhabitants, who occupied the Dniester bridge (Ibid.) A second Moldovan attempt to cross the Lunga bridge took place on 13 December 1991.After this second failed attempt, there was a lull in military activity until 2 March 1992, considered the beginning of the War of Transnistria. Moldova was admitted as a member of the United Nations on August 27, 1991, after its formal declaration of independence ((Ibid.) The armed conflict lasted until 21 July 1992, in three areas along the Dniester river. The cold conflict was briefly hot.A ceasefire agreement was signed on 21 July. This official document, whose details were primarily dictated by Moscow, was signed by the presidents of Russia (Boris Yeltsin) and Moldova (Mircea Snegur (Ibid.) The agreement provided for peacekeeping forces to observe the ceasefire involving Russian, Moldovan, and PMR battalions under the orders of a joint military command structure, the Joint Control Commission (JCC). It is estimated that nearly a thousand people were killed in total, with many others wounded (Ibid.)Unlike many other post-Soviet conflicts, IDP’s (internally displaced persons) did not reach large numbers in the War of Transnistria. Volunteers from Russia and Ukraine, including Don and Kuban Cossacks, fought on Transnistria’s side (Ibid.) There is no interpretative consensus on the precise number of volunteers or the exact military role they played in the Transnistrian conflict, but these militias probably numbered several thousand (Ibid.)Memories of the Civil WarDuring the Transnistria War, UNA-UNSO members fought alongside Transnistrian separatists against Moldovan government forces to defend the sizable ethnic-Ukrainian minority in Transnistria (Ibid.) Shortly before the escalation of the conflict in late June 1992, Romania provided military support to Moldova by supplying weaponry and sending ubiquitous military advisers (Ibid.) Volunteers from Romania also fought on Moldova’s side. However, the exact numbers recruited are disputed, and the militarization was undoubtedly something of an irregular recruitment drive and may have offered more political than strategic military weight.Moldova held a snap parliamentary election on 11 July 2021. Ahead of the vote, there was controversy over whether polling stations should be opened in the disputed territory of Transnistria to allow Moldovan citizens living in the region to participate in the election (Grzegorcczyk, 2021). It was argued that the opening of polling stations would be illegal, and the Moldovan authorities would be unable to guarantee a fair electoral process.Finally, and late in the day, the Central Election Commission (CEC) decided against polling in Transnistria itself (Ibid.) It was a bit like this rump part of the country cast a dark and foreboding shadow over the entire election. The memorialization and evidence of mortality from this long-running conflict litter the classrooms and public buildings of modern Moldova. The past is still present, and the frozen war constantly threatens a volcanic upsurge. Perhaps this snap election may bring a rocky road to democraticand the 2021 Parliamentary ElectionsThe territory occupied by the Transnistrian independent authority is located within the internationally recognized borders of Moldova. The Transnistrians are primarily supported by the Russian Federation, which maintains a military presence in the region. For all intents and purposes, it is “Little Russia,” a fact which is reflected in the import and export of all significant non-perishable goods (Vlas, 2021.) Although Transnistria continues to fall under Moldovan jurisdiction, life in the territory is regulated by the legislation adopted by the secessionist authorities and is solidly Russian speaking (Ibid.)Moldovan legislation is neither practically effective nor statutorily enforced in Transnistria. In a surprising decision on 5 June, the Central Electoral Commission had initially sanctioned the opening of 44 polling stations in Transnistria, 41 of which are located on territory under the constitutional control of the Moldovan authorities and three of which are in areas controlled by the secessionist authorities. This is the first occasion the CEC has advised that polling stations should be opened in areas controlled by the separatist authorities.Moldovan citizens living in Transnistria can exercise their right to vote in the specially opened polling stations in the areas controlled by the Moldovan authorities (Ibid.)What thinking underlines the CEC decision? Well, the motivation is relatively pragmatic and straightforward. The answer lies partly because the Transnistrian electorate is viewed as more pro-Russian and supportive of communist and socialist parties (Ibid.) Moldovan parties of that ilk backed them having the chance to run their polling bureau.A few opportunistic parties thought that they could exploit an electorate being poorly informed about Moldovan politics. For many years no electoral debates are held in the territory for politically obvious reasons. Any formal or informal election campaigning in the past by anyone unsympathetic to Moscow has resulted in public disorder and occasionally riots (Ibid.) Certain parties, therefore, have a stake in opening polling stations in Transnistria, not least because it would provide opportunities for electoral fraud. In the end, they did not get the chance to gain from this largesse.Although the CEC’s decision was ultimately annulled, it has raised some critical questions about Moldova’s capacity to organize free and fair elections and how Transnistria can be genuinely integrated into this process. Moldovan citizens living in the occupied areas of Transnistria certainly have the same rights as those living in the territory controlled by the constitutional authorities. Few could dispute the argument raised by several opportunistic parties that they should vote and express their opinions freely and fairly. However, finally, the CEC decided this should only be done following the existing legislation and international standards (Tanas, 2021.) Otherwise, Moldova would effectively have to delegate aspects of its sovereignty to the secessionist authorities. So, the elections did not cross the river, and all polling stations were kept within Moldovan territorial control.Results of the 2021 ElectionThe Pro-Western President Maia Sandu’s Party decisively took these Moldovan snap parliamentary elections. Almost all Western election observer missions noted “smooth” and “peaceful” as adjectives to describe polling and counting. Sandu’s center-right Action and Solidarity (PAS) achieved almost 53%, and the former President Igor Dodon’s Socialists and Communists (BECS) bloc barely 27 percent. In geographical curiosities like Transnistria, this may ameliorate the shadowy sense of “Russian under the table dominance” and help to pull local politics back into the mainstream orbit of Moldovan pro-western centrism (Ibid.) In time, that may weaken Russia’s influence in the country (Ibid.)The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA), the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), and the European Parliament in a joint statement described elections as “competitive and well-run” despite some shortcomings (Ibid.) International Observers certainly saw evidence of PACE’s concerns about (relatively isolated and low-level) but (nevertheless) potentially biased election administration and campaign financing. Few locations could have been politically sensitive or open to “low key” electoral bribery as Transnistria (Ibid.) In time, this hotbed of Communist-era nostalgia may lose its resolutely SovietObservationsTransnistria’s pro-Moscow stance may also dissipate as the economic attraction of Romanian and European Union cooperation injects political realism into a conversation that has been for too long about “red” if not “rose-tinted” Communist reminiscence. Many international observers noted in their statements that “it was a privilege to be part of an electoral process” in one of the poorest countries in Europe, which (in juxtaposition) possesses one of the richest agricultural and folk histories (Ibid.)Apart from the likes of Transnistria, the general post-election atmosphere was probably relief that the result had been decisive. It was difficult to detect any sense of enthusiasm with mainstream Moldovan politics. In an election scarred by corruption and undelivered political promises, few political saints were on display. However, Sandu was undoubtedly seen as a “least bad” option among a sea of convicted criminals and political lightweights.For the time being, the political leanings are likely to be more Brussels than Moscow-focused. Ultimately, the size of the electoral majority suggests that Sandu may have sufficient parliamentary power to do some good. That said, Transnistria remains a ticking time-bomb severing the mainstream European leanings of Moldova’s majority community from its beleaguered Russians. Like that old CCCP Grandfather clock in the attic, the time for renewed conflict with Moscow could percolate any hour, threatening the new European leanings of this impoverished Euro-state. This may threaten the newfound stability achieved by Sandu and be reflected in a decisive political victory. The Party of Action and Solidarity received 52.80% of the vote and won an absolute majority in parliament, taking 63 of the 101 seats, an increase of 48 (Ibid.) President of Moldova Maia Sandu stated after the election: “I hope that today is the end of a hard era for Moldova, I hope today is the end of the reign of thieves over Moldova.” (Ibid.) She must (however) do something about Transnistria and other minority claims. Minorities have a way of “punching above their weight” in this remarkable region, still schizophrenic in its modernization trends and ancient traditions."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/29/unthinkable-and-invisible-international-relations/,Unthinkable and Invisible International Relations,Zeynep Gülşah Çapan,Jul 29 2021,"The colonial underpinnings of International Relations (IR) have been receiving increasing attention (Grovogui 2006, Krishna 2006, Sabaratnam 2011, Çapan 2017a, Shilliam 2021). The discipline has addressed its own Eurocentrism in a myriad of ways such as non-Western IR and Global IR. (Acharya and Buzan 2009, Acharya 2014). One of the shortcomings of these approaches has been a focus on adding more perspectives into an already existing account of the international rather than questioning the politics of knowledge that constitute the international (Çapan 2020). This intervention aims to elaborate further on the politics of knowledge that continue to make events, histories and knowledges unthinkable and invisible within the discipline.The notion of unthinkability is borrowed from Trouillot’s (1995) discussion of the Haitian Revolution. He argued that the Haitian Revolution ‘entered history with the peculiar characteristic of being unthinkable even as it happened’, as contemporaries failed to ‘understand the ongoing revolution on its own terms’, as they ‘could read the news only with their ready-made categories, and these categories were incompatible with the idea of a slave revolution’ (Trouillot 1995: 73). He argues that there are two tropes within narratives of Haitian revolution: formulas of erasure and formulas of banalization (Trouillot 1995:96). The formulas of erasure ‘erase directly the fact of a revolution’ whereas formulas of banalization ‘empty a number of singular events of their revolutionary content so that the entire string of facts, […] become trivialized’ (Trouillot 1995: 96).The banalization happens through narratives that argue that the revolution ‘must have been ‘prompted’, ‘provoked’, or ‘suggested’ by some higher being than the slaves themselves: royalists, mulattoes, or other external agents’ (Trouillot 1995: 103). The formulas of banalization are important in problematizing the discussions around ‘bringing in history’ into IR to address its ahistoricism and Eurocentrism (Hobson and Lawson 2008, Buzan and Lawson 2015). The focus on bringing in more facts to correct erroneous narratives overlooks what Trouillot points to, which is that even when an event is ‘known’ it might continue to be ‘unthinkable’ on its own terms. As such, the aim should not be to solely bring in more facts but explore the unthinkable through making the invisible visible (Çapan 2017b, 2020).Events, histories and knowledges become unthinkable because of what Santos (2007, 2015) calls ‘abyssal thinking’. Santos (2007: 45) argues that ‘modern western thinking is abyssal thinking’ that consists of a ‘system of visible and invisible distinctions’. The division works to make the ‘other side of the line’ nonexistent. With respect to systems of knowledge it means that modern science is accorded ‘the monopoly of the universal distinction between true and false, to the detriment of two alternative bodies of knowledge: philosophy and theology’ (Santos, 2007: 47). The disputes between science, philosophy and theology happen on the visible side of the abyssal line. The visibility of these disputes is based on the ‘invisibility of forms of knowledge that cannot be fitted into any of these ways of knowledge’ such as ‘lay, plebian, peasant, or indigenous knowledges’ (Santos, 2007: 47).As a consequence, knowledges on the invisible side are categorized as ‘beliefs, opinions, intuitive or subjective understandings’ and are ‘rendered incommensurable and incomprehensible for meeting neither the scientific methods of truth nor their acknowledged contesters in the realm of philosophy and theology’ (Santos, 2007:47).Thus, the banalization that Trouillot discusses happens because of the way forms of knowledge on the invisible side have not been categorized as knowledge and, as a consequence, events on the ‘other side’ can never be understood on their own terms and become ‘unthinkable’. This dynamic is demonstrated in Hulme’s (1978: 119) discussion of Columbus and the Cannibals where he argues that the ‘supposed “communication” between European and native was in effect a European monologue’. It was a monologue because ‘Europe took to America an interpretative grid with which to observe what it found’ (Hulme 1978: 132).the knowledge systems, histories and subjecthoods of the indigenous populations became invisible as they had to fit into the ‘interpretative grids’ of the Europeans. This dynamic is what has allowed the narrative of the ‘discovery of America’ to become dominant and the process of the ‘invention of America’ became invisible (O’Gorman 1972). The existence of knowledges, histories and subjecthoods becomes, within the visible system of knowledge, unthinkable.In terms of the discipline of International Relations, the ‘big debates’ have occurred on the visible side of the abyssal line. The invisible side of the abyssal line has been characterized as beliefs and superstitions, and has not been included in the account of the making of the international. The question then becomes how to access the invisible that has been made unthinkable through the ‘interpretative grids’ of the scientific method.An example of that process is given in Robbie Shilliam’s (2014) article ‘Open the Gates Mek We Repatriate’. In that article, he analyzes the ‘politics of knowledge production’ whereby ‘a privileged group, the ‘scholastic caste’, possesses the power to de-value the explanations of ‘lay’ groups’ experiences by deeming them to be insufficiently ‘scientific’’ (Shilliam 2014: 350). He problematizes the way in which constructivist literature has engaged with the topic of ‘abolition of and emancipation from Atlantic slavery’. He does this through the hermeneutics of Erna Brodber who suggested ‘to stop seeing ‘slaves’ and to see instead ‘enslaved persons’ (Shilliam 2014: 360). Brodber’s oral history project challenges the ‘progressive timeline’ used by constructivists that presents ‘a before and after of slavery’ and underlines that ‘the slaving past is alive and brought inside the present because the ancestors and spirits of the past have personhood and exercise agency in here and now’ (Shilliam 2014: 363). Thus, Shilliam (2014) asks:Can the meanings of freedom that are popularly signified by ‘abolition’ really be adequate if they have silenced the meanings mobilized by descendants of enslaved Africans in their ongoing struggle for spiritual, psychical and substantive emancipation (368).What Shilliam’s problematization is doing is then to make the knowledges, histories and experiences that were left on the invisible side of the abyssal line visible.In conclusion, attempts at addressing the Eurocentrism of the field have predominantly focused on how to make present what was absented from the narrative of the making of the international (Çapan 2020). This has meant that events, histories and knowledges were added into an already existing account of the international rather than questioning the politics of knowledge that has constituted that account of the international. This intervention has underlined that International Relations as a discipline has to work towards making the invisible visible in a way that addresses the politics of knowledge and interrogates what events, histories and knowledges have become unthinkable in our narratives of the making of the international."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/28/the-appeals-and-the-limits-of-digital-education-in-the-post-covid-era/,The Appeals and the Limits of Digital Education in the Post-Covid Era,Sirvan Karimi,Jul 28 2021,"Though shifting to online teaching and learning has been a persistent trend for the last two decades, remotely delivered teaching has become a pervasive and ubiquitous worldwide phenomenon during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no misgiving that the staggering impact of COVID-19 on education sector will cement e-learning as an indispensable ingredient of the traditional teaching and learning system. The intensification of the shift to digital teaching and learning is alleged to have the potential to reduce educational costs, diminish bargaining leverage of faculty and teachers’ unions in the education sector, and enhance learning capacity of students. Contrary to the views of ardent exponents of online teaching and learning, it can be demonstrated that e-learning neither reduces educational costs nor can it undermine the bargaining leverage of faculty and teachers’ unions.Online delivery of education is believed to have provided a golden opportunity to significantly reduce educational costs. The pathways to the realization of low educational cost through digital teaching and learning are; increasing student-teacher ratios (increasing enrollment in each section of a coursesince there is no spatial limitation), transferring certain educational activities to computers, curtailing salary costsby redesigning processes that would facilitate aneffective and efficient utilization of teacher time, reducing school-based facility costs, and realizingeconomies of scale by leveraging initial development costs as widely as possible (Bakia, et al. 2012; alsoMorris, 2008).Generally, the potential cost-saving of online delivery of both public and private services is massive (European Commission, 2016). Governments and businesses have seized this opportunity to reduce both administrative and transaction costs, and hence improve their service delivery performance. A good quality education combined with promoting equity is a sine quo non to a well-functioning, stable and productive society (OECD, 2012). Therefore, cost efficiency should not be the only factor taken into consideration when educational reforms are undertaken. Furthermore, education is a unique good whose quality assurance requirements can hinder the achievement of cost efficiency associated with the economics of scale. In other words, cost efficient delivery of services might be difficult to realize in the education sector.As an opportunity to reduce salary costs, increasing the student-teacher ratio purports to be an attractive and tantalizing option to school administrators. However, this policy option runs counter to maintaining quality assurance standards in educational institutions. In addition to a robust digital infrastructure, incessant IT support for faculty, and the need for teachers to be skillful in using technology, lowering student-teacher ratio is one of the most significant factors that can ensure maintaining quality assurance for online courses (Bates, 2019). There is a general consensus that class size is positively correlated with the quality of interaction between teachers and students (Burch, 2019). In their study of faculty’s attitudes toward online teaching, Lowenthal Patrick et al (2019) have found that it was the strong conviction of faculty members under study that smaller online classes were conducive to fostering student learning and faculty satisfaction. Furthermore, they found out that “some faculty perceive high-enrollment online courses as antithetical to student success” (p.65).The student-teacher ratio is a significant indicator of the level of resources devoted to education (OECD, 2007). In fact, one of the main impetuses behind the inclination of many parents to send their children to private schools is class size (National Council of Teachers of English, 2014).Despite their differences in their methodologies, a significant number of researchers have agreed that an optimal class size for an online university or college course should range from 8–20 students (Burch, 2019). Such an optimal class size requirement which is imperative to maintaining quality assurance standards, can hardly culminate in curtailing salary costs. In fact, educational institutions might be required to hire more teachers if they decided to shift to onlinethe higher education literature, economics of scale is widely identified as one of the propelling forces behind the accelerating move to digital teaching and learning (Morris, 2008). Higher educational institutions are in a position to digitize education and extend their students recruitment reach to the global level. In accordance with the application of economics of scales to online learning, large scale organizations such as universities can achieve economies of scale by developing processes and systems that permit additional growth at marginal cost (Morris, 2008). Once new sections of a given course are added, the growth of enrollment revenues will soar faster than any cost related to adding additional sections. It is based on this anticipation of efficiency gains that many higher educational institutions are enticed to devote substantial levels of resources to the development of online courses.However, there are certain substantive obstacles to the achievement of economics of scale in the education sector. These structural and institutional constraints to the realization of economics of scale in the education sector are the corollaries of the prevailing governance structure in higher educational institutions. In line with the existing institutional governance model, faculty members not only participate in governance but also enjoy academic freedom, which generally refers to the freedom that faculty members have in teaching and conducting research in order to explore and disseminate knowledge that contributes to the common goods of society. The institutionalization of academic freedom which has historically been buttressed by collective bargaining mechanism, provides greater latitude for faculty members in determining the design and content of courses that they teach (AAUP, 1994).Similarly, the design of online courses which has a significant impact on student performance, is mainly shaped by faculty members who are assigned to teach online courses (Jaggars & XU, 2016). Since different sections of the same online course are taught by different faculty members, there will inevitably be significant variation in learning outcomes, textbooks, and other reading material requirements. As result of such a unique faculty specify approach to learning and pedagogical philosophy, total costs will increase rather than decrease for educational institutions (Cini & Princeas, 2014). Other things being equal, the lack of a centralized and unified teaching and learning model is a source of inefficiency, and hence an obstacle to scaling online education. Put simply, schools and higher educational institutions are not manufacturing facilities where through the application of assembly line and use of skilled and semi-skilled workforce large scale standardized goods can be produced. As Theocharis Kromydas has pointed out:Education is not similar to a manufacturing production line, since students are highly concerned about the quality of education they receive as opposed to motor cars, which are indifferent to the process by which they are manufactured (2017, 2).The institutional constraints to the achievement of economics of scale in relation to online learning and teaching cast doubt on a widely held assumption that the shift to digital education will corrode the pillars faculty and teachers’ unions power base.In his assessment of the fateful ramifications of distance education for teachers’ unions, Terry Moe, the author of Special Interest: Teachers Unions and America’s Public Schools, has asserted that digital revolution will bring a massive cost saving substitution of technology for labor, and hence, fewer teachers per student will be needed (Moe, 2011). Moe has gone further to argue that technology-driven dispersal of teaching force has the potential to engender formidable and insurmountable challenges for faculty and teachers’ unions to maintain their social cohesion which is a preclude to displaying their bargaining power to elicit concessions from school administrators. Moe has therefore, concluded that online teaching makes it difficult for teachers to gather in one physical location and hence undermining their ability to organize, which he characterized as “a big blow to their powerpurports to have ignored two important points. First, it is a pure fantasy and self-deception to suggest that enlarging enrollment in a single online class which is intended to save costs and hence reduce the number of teachers, can guarantee maintaining quality assurance standards. Second, if technology can allow many students across different geographical settings to enroll in online courses, faculty and teachers’ unions can also utilize the same technology to retain their organizational cohesion and solidarity through holding large scale virtual conferences and meetings. If physical space is no longer a requirement for learning and teaching as Moe has asserted, then physical presence of teachers in a specific location is no longer an indispensable condition for maintaining organizational solidarity and cohesion.It is indisputable that technology can be utilized as an aiding and facilitating tool to learning and teaching. However, technology can never replace teachers. It would be a fatal flaw to expect technology to substitute the knowledge and life experience that effective and emphatic teachers can transmit to students (Owen, 2015). Furthermore, teaching is relational since positive teacher-student interactions are an essential ingredient of students’ learning experience. As Andreas Schleicher (2020) has pointed out, “COVID-19 has reinforced the notion that learning is not a transactional experience but a relational and social experience, and that assessment must guide student and system improvement” (para.4).Furthermore, Victoria Cain and Adam Laatts (2021) have convincingly argued that historical experience with the use of technology in education system in the United States has shown that technology is “a poor solution to teacher shortages”. Cain and Laats have also reminded policy makers that:In the present as in the past, they [policy makers] will get only what they pay for. Technology can be a tool for teachers and students, but it cannot replace the role of a trained, engaged human teacher. As parents have come to appreciate during the pandemic, in person teaching inspires students far more than Zoom school ever will. In person, teachers can connect and engage with students that screens cannot simply replicate (para 18).The enthusiasm of the advocates of e-learning tends to overcloud and obfuscate institutional and structural barriers to the achievement of the economics of scale in the education sector. There is no doubt that technology can be harnessed as a useful tool at the service of teaching and learning. However, technology is an appendage to effective teachers not vice versa."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/19/where-angels-fear-to-tread-how-to-make-global-business-responsible/,Where Angels Fear to Tread: How to Make Global Business Responsible,David Kinley,Jul 19 2021,"‘The political problem of mankind is to combine three things: economic efficiency, social justice and individual liberty,’ wrote John Maynard Keynes in his essay on Liberalism and Labour 95 years ago. Before then, and especially since, we have striven to balance these often awkward and sometimes competing aspirations with varying degrees of commitment and success. It was no accident that Keynes emphasised the singularity of the problem – everything else in the realm of politics either falls within or flows from this trifecta – reflecting the febrile times of the Great Depression on the edge of which Keynes was then writing. Clearly, he mused, the unbridled freedom to make profits does not alone create a sustainable economy, still less build a viable society (Keynes, 1926a).ProgressSome of the cruellest inequities of Dickensian and robber baron capitalism that still characterised the economy in Keynes’ day have since been tackled (endemic child labour and the active subjugation of opportunities for women and racial minorities), if not yet eliminated. And the regulation of corporate affairs by states is now expected, if not always fit for purpose or warmly welcomed by the corporations themselves. Today, few big businesses are unaware of the expectations made of them to be socially responsible and environmentally aware. They must earn their social licence to operate above and beyond their legal licence of incorporation. Or, as the US Business Round Table put it in its historic 2019 Statement, the purpose of a corporation is to “benefit all stakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders” (a far cry indeed from its ardent insistence 22 years earlier that ‘the principal objective of a business enterprise is to generate economic returns for its owners’).No self-respecting multinational company these days can afford not to have bold statements of their green credentials and their fealty to human rights (BHRRC) on their corporate website, even if it is not always clear to observers and the corporate boards alike what that actually means in practice. This last point being one reason why the now decade old UN’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights have attracted so much corporate support, because they provide some guidance on what that practice might look like.From this fine rhetoric of these soft laws, some new hard laws have emerged. For example, corporate human rights due diligence statutes in France, The Netherlands and (soon) the EU, as well as modern slavery legislation in the UK and Australia. Other legal avenues for holding corporations to account have also been re-invigorated, such as domestic tort laws (Lindt, 2020), of which the US Alien Tort Statute is but one example, which is still – just – hanging in there (Desierto & Song, 2021).it seems, may be taking seriously its role in solving the Keynesian problem. Corporations paying attention to matters of ‘integrity’ and ‘social responsibility’, which leading Harvard corporate lawyer Victor Brudney lamented 40 years ago were then being too readily sacrificed at the altar of ‘efficiency’. Perhaps we are witnessing the ‘civilising’ of globalisation, as I’ve argued for elsewhere (Kinley, 2009), or we are seeing the saving of capitalism by it being made more ‘accountable’ to the citizenry, as erstwhile financiers Michael O’Leary and Warren Valdmanis argue (O’Leary & Valdmanis, 2020)?RegressYet corporate carelessness and bastardry still happen. Lucrative export markets in developed states continue to encourage ‘race to the bottom’ competition between and within developing economies.Eight years after more than 1,100 garment workers died when the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, unsafe workplaces are still claiming lives, with the city’s latest atrocity in July 2021 caused by fire and padlocked doorways in a food processing plant employing children as young as 11 years old. The biggest names in the extractives industries continue to fail to learn safety lessons with devastating consequences. Vale has presided over the collapse of two tailings dams in Brazil in the space of four years, killing more than 300 people and precipitating environmental catastrophes (Zimmermann).Meanwhile, those seeking to expose corporate human rights abuses are subject to physical, financial or legal attacks. The redoubtable Business and Human Rights Resource Centre has tracked more than 3,250 such attacks globally since 2015, including the growing use of corporate-sponsored ‘SLAPP’ lawsuits seeking to silence whistle-blowers and human rights defenders. And despite business leaders continually telling data collectors BSR and GlobeScan that human rights are their number one priority in terms of sustainability concerns, in practice, their companies are still not walking the talk. Reviewing the annual results of the landmark Corporate Human Rights Benchmark of 200 leading corporations, for example, Robert Eccles bluntly concluded in 2020 that it seems ‘human rights really aren’t all that important to [them]’.Reset?So, the picture is mixed, and we are right to demand more, better and quicker. But it would be a mistake not to acknowledge the profound shifts over the last 30 years in attitudes toward and within corporations as to what capitalism is expected to deliver. Environmental sensibilities are no longer corporate externalities but core business concerns, and while social and human rights concerns are not yet quite so ensconced, they are beating the same path through board room doors. Our perspective therefore on what progress has been made should be generational and not just immediate.Harbingers of what is to come can be gleaned from potentially ideological tipping points in the contemporary landscape, the significance of which, while yet to be fully understood, is nevertheless palpable. Three emerging trends or initiatives today occupy this category, together giving legitimate reason to believe that some sort of corporate/society reset might becapitalistsPhilanthrocapitalism borne on the backs of eponymous foundations spun off from principal business enterprises has its place within our modern economies, helping to heal the sick (Novo Nordisk and Gates Foundations), care for children (INGKA Foundation), and combat climate change (Bloomberg Philanthropies). Reflecting the conscience of some capitalists to ‘give back’ such efforts are important and laudable, but they are not capitalism proper being, in effect, post-profit. It is when such concerns form part of a corporation’s thinking pre-profit that they become truly significant; when how you make a profit more than what you spend it on constitutes the key question when contemplating a corporation’s social or environmental impact.The mantra of ESG (‘Environment, Social and Governance’) has gone viral throughout international business. The desire to be seen to care about such matters has been driven by forces coming from a somewhat unlikely source. The finance sector has long been a holdout in terms of understanding or even acknowledging its social and environmental responsibilities, and yet it is from the ranks of major investors, asset holders and wealth managers that calls for ESG consciousness are loudest (Kinley,appetite for sustainability investing has grown exponentially especially, for example, in so-called green and social bonds. ESG investment and advisory services have mushroomed – global management consultancy firm McKinsey’s description of its recent acquisitions in the field as ‘enabl[ing] us to help clients across all sectors and geographies … to successfully navigate the risks and opportunities presented by the economy-wide transition to a more sustainable future’ reflects well this trend.Perhaps most significantly of all are the assertive stances adopted by investors like BlackRock, the world’s largest asset holder. In his celebrated annual letters to CEOs worldwide, Larry Fink, the firm’s CEO, has long championed the value of long-term sustainability investment strategies. This stance, he notes in his 2021 letter, is not just environmentally friendly but also financially prudent, as sustainability investment indexes now consistently outperform their parent benchmarks – an outcome he labels as a ‘sustainability premium’. BlackRock’s latest statement on human rights also hammers home the point that human rights risks are not ephemeral but core – that is to say ‘material’ – to all corporations today and therefore cannot be ignored. The market takes heed of such proclamations when they are made by a company that commands an investment portfolio valued in excess of $9 trillion.Tree-hugging judgesCorporate motivations to connect with their socially responsible soul are not always so benign or self-serving. In two recent European court cases, for example, judges have made clear that certain environmental standards of behaviour by corporations are not just optional or desirable, but they are legally enforceable.The first of these cases involved the right to environmental protection enshrined in the French Constitution. Curious though it may seem to Anglo-Saxon eyes, such rights are found readily in the constitutions and laws of many countries in Europe as well as Africa and South America (Zimmer, 2021). It is in the common law world (with the notable exception of Ireland) and, oddly, also in international human rights law more broadly, that there is general absence of express protection of environmental rights (Rodríguez-Garavito, 2018). Be that as it may, in early 2020 France’s highest court, the Conseil Constitutionnel, was called upon to decide whether the constitutional command to preserve the environment as ‘the common heritage of all mankind,’ trumps the equally constitutionally protected right to free commercial enterprise. It does, the court concluded, upholding a statute banning the production, storage and transport of certain agricultural pesticide products.The second case, this one before a Dutch court, went even further, holding that oil giant Shell (incorporated in the Netherlands) owes a duty of care under Dutch law to take appropriate actions to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Adopting a legal approach much more familiar to common law lawyers and judges (namely, tort), the Hague District Court handed down a remarkable judgment in May 2021, arguing that ‘on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances, the best available science on dangerous climate change and how to manage it, and the widespread international consensus that human rights offer protection against the impacts of dangerous climate change … companies must respect human rights.’ It added that in this particular case Shell has an obligation to amend its group corporate policy accordingly, including, specifically, to affect a reduction in its group-wide CO2 emissions by net 45% by the end ofpotential impact of the case can hardly be overestimated. For in its express reliance on the extent of scientific knowledge about the adverse health and environmental impacts of climate change, the court echoes the litany of toxic tort litigation against tobacco and asbestos companies (pioneered in the US and followed in the UK and Australia) that spelled the reordering and near demise of those industries (Rabin, 1992; Carroll et al, 2005). The critical difference here is that the responsibility to prevent known harms caused by CO2 emissions embraces a far wider category of corporations than just oil and gas companies, potentially including any business entity with a significant emissions footprint.Rendering unto Caesar…In a geopolitical world still characterised by the centrality of the state, the actions taken by governments to encourage or compel corporations to be socially responsible are of primary importance. Good corporate citizenry driven by ‘business case’ reasoning (i.e. what is good for the bottom line) or forced upon corporations by vanguard judiciaries are all well and good, but for authoritative leadership in making business truly accountable to the public interest, we should and must look to the states themselves.States often fail to lead, of course. Either because individually their politics are captured by the economic power of corporations or because together they are unable or unwilling to cooperate and coordinate their actions which in our globalised economy is nearly always fatal. This is why the recent OECD-brokered initiative to establish a global minimum corporate tax is so astounding.For decades, multinational corporations have been able to minimise their tax liabilities by a combination of transfer pricing (shifting group profits to low or no tax jurisdictions while parking liabilities in high tax states) and extensive use of tax lawyers to exploit as many tax breaks and loopholes as possible. Especially prevalent in the services and technology sectors where products are non-tangible (and therefore easily shifted), the strategic use of tax laws is rife among global businesses. The chorus of discontent in rich as well as poor countries over this state of affairs has, finally, prompted the OECD to take a stand, for whether by way of clever avoidance or illegal evasion, the result sure looks like tax dodging to most regular tax-payers and voters (Kinley, 2018, 156-60).Following the recent G20 Meeting in Venice, a twin pillar, in-principle agreement has been signed off by a total of 130 countries to set a minimum corporate tax rate for all major multinational corporations, classified as those with annual revenue of more than $890m (estimates suggest there are 8,000 such entities). Set at 15%, the idea is to establish a floor beneath which large corporations cannot lower the tax they must pay somewhere (Pillar 2). No longer therefore will corporations be able to shelter their profits in low tax jurisdictions (according to the Tax Foundation, there are currently 35 countries in which the top corporate tax rate is beneath 15%). And nor, under Pillar 1, will the 78 or so largest and most profitable corporations be able entirely to avoid paying tax in states in which they generate profit rather than where they are headquartered (Devereux & Simmler, 2021). Altogether, according to the OECD, these clawbacks could be worth up to an additional $240 billion in tax revenue eachall countries are keen on the deal. Hungary, Ireland and Estonia, for example, have been great beneficiaries of exceedingly low corporate tax rates and will likely have to be forced to sign up (by the deal-bound countries increasing taxes to the minimum rate specifically for global corporations located in hold-out states). And there remains the daunting task of working out the details of how the tax will be collected and dispersed. But these problems aside, there is no denying the significance of such co-ordinated global intent to hold corporations to account on such a pivotal issue. It will halt the ‘30-year race to the bottom on corporate tax rates’, as US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen grandiloquently put it.Silver liningsIt is, in truth, still too soon to say whether all these promising signs will deliver significant and long-lasting change to the role of corporations in our societies. They are, after all, silver linings still surrounded by dark clouds. Both the finance and extractive sectors, for example, managed to exempt themselves from the global tax redistribution deal under Pillar 1 mentioned above, despite comprising some of the wealthiest and most profitable enterprises on Earth. Damascene conversion to the environmental cause is by no means universal. Oil behemoth Exxon, backed by its major institutional investors, for instance, have steadfastly resisted for more than 30 years numerous efforts by minority shareholders to change the company’s climate change-denying corporate policies. And in our Financial Services Human Rights Benchmark, Kym Sheehan and I show how understanding of the relevance of human rights throughout banking and financial services companies is still severely hampered by the fact that boards routinely take no heed of human rights risks as opportunities. Finally, for all the consequential symbolism of a new global corporate tax regime, the fact is that the tax revenue benefits will go largely to rich states, and of the 60 or so countries not party to the agreement (and who therefore will receive no additional tax receipts), nearly all are poor and most in need of cooperative measures to staunch the cross-border flows of illicit finance from their public coffers.In his most famous work, The General Theory, Keynes suggested that a market economy will not reach its full potential of benefiting all of society and not just those with capital until such time as we can get ‘rid of the objectionable features of capitalism’ (Keynes, 1936 [at 221]; Cardim de Carvalho, 2009). The trends discussed in this brief article may not themselves be sufficient in that monumental task, but they are, at least, pointing in the right direction."

In light of cuts to aid, this article argues the UK Government is hiding behind girls’ education in the Global South as a means invoke wider development outcomes – eradicate poverty, prevent conflict, reduce overpopulation. Bangladesh provides an example of how these funding cuts will impact aid agencies and the communities they serve.In recent months, the UK Government has renewed efforts towards girls’ education and progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goal on Education, with the aim of getting 40 million more girls in school by 2026, and 20 million more girls reading by age 10. Addressing these targets is a £55 million pledge in pursuit of research into education reforms – What Works Hub for Global Education – “ to advise governments across Africa and Asia on the most impactful and cost-effective ways to reform school systems and support female enrolment”. This article argues that such efforts are the latest examples of how the pursuit of global ‘gender equality’ and assumptions about girlhood in the Global South have become firmly entrenched in neoliberal logic.The UK Government is hiding behind girls’ education in the Global South as a means to invoke wider development outcomes – eradicate poverty, prevent conflict, reduce overpopulation. For example, this new programme is reasoned to “protect the UK from the consequences of conflict”, and “lead to smaller, healthier and better educated families”. Education is made out to be a silver bullet towards female empowerment: an educated girl of the Global South is assumed to be empowered, and thereby stereotyped as a selfless, entrepreneurial, rational economic agent who can supposedly address the structural drivers of poverty and gender inequity. Seen by the UK Government as an “untapped resource”, the lack of educational attainment in Global South girlhoods is falsely imagined as the locus of global inequalities.The valorisation of girls’ education comes to mask how the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has, at the same time, cut overseas UK aid expenditure 29% in the last year; small charities have been hit the hardest, and aid agencies and UK university research programmes are now struggling to effectively plan given the tenuity of their funding statuses. New thematic categories outline new priority areas for FCDO, framed in accordance with ‘value for taxpayers’, in which girls’ education is included as a cost-efficient fix-all in light of aid reduction. And yet, the 2021 commitment to girls’ education is set at 400million a year, where it was at 672million in the year of 2016. It is also worth interrogating what counts as a baseline in the UK’s targets towards girls’ education, given the immediate need to recover girls that have dropped out of school in light of the pandemic on top of pre-pandemic global targets.FCDO has put aid agencies around the world in precarious positions, with country budgets still unannounced, terminated contracts, and no consultation in these actions. This is particularly apparent in Bangladesh, a notable exemplary country given its history as a once British colonial territory under the larger ‘British India’. In Bangladesh, though girls’ secondary school enrolment has increased from 39% in 1998 to 67% in 2017, girls’ secondary school dropout rates sit at 47% in recent years – demonstrating that ‘getting girls into school’ is only half the story in educational attainment. Factors such as child marriage and household responsibilities, particularly in rural areas, are certainly responsible, which are attributive of a context with deep economic and employment inequalities. Despite these needs, with no commitment from FCDO going forward, Bangladesh rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) have cut down on targeted support towards “the ultra-poor, education and work on women’s empowerment”. The Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center notes that, given around half of Bangladesh’s population is under 25, the withdrawal of FCDO from the youth development is “disappointing”. In light of the emphasis on girls’ education, it is also deeply2017 Bangladesh has been reckoning with humanitarian crisis brought on by a mass migration of Rohingya refugees, fleeingviolence in Myanmar to seek refuge across the border in Bangladesh. It is thought around 700,000 Rohingya refugees – more than 50% of whom are children – are now in Bangladesh and face inadequate and unsafe shelter and living facilities. Cuts in UK aid to Bangladesh has put in crisis a commitment to the Rohingya children, who require “basic services including food, water and healthcare, as well as protection for women and girls”.And yet, UK aid cannot be considered an inherent force for good, given the deep parallels between the modern aid system and coloniality. Self-interest in the UK aid framework is not lost. As a cheap expression of British soft power, aid ‘recipient’ countries and their citizens are hoped to be more favourable to the UK: the UK can benefit from being less drawn into conflicts and prosper as a location of brain gain (receiving highly skilled and qualified immigrant workers). At the very least, aid may provide more opportunity for aid agencies and researchers to more aptly allocate funding rather than as a means of the UK’s own introversion. The guise of supposedly improving girls’ agencies through education has come during an epistemological period of ‘bottom-up’ development that seeks to give more decision-making abilities and funding resources to local partners. And yet, the UK government has opted to pull the rug out from under these actors.Education – of all genders – is deeply embedded in wider systemic issues of equity and must take into account actual quality of the learning environment. Girls and students who are not gender conforming, are disproportionately vulnerable to erasure, discrimination, and violence from teachers, staff, and peers. Such understandings are lost in the FCDO’s latest actions. Girls‘ education is instrumentalised to push aside more complex understandings of gender inequities, particularly those that attribute exploitative capitalism and structural adjustment. And so, getting girls into school is a much more political matter than meets the eye; one that can be used to mask deep financial cuts for aid agencies worldwide and burden the responsibility of global ‘gender equality’ onto a young girl.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/19/the-south-tyrol-model-ethnic-pacification-in-a-nutshell/,The South Tyrol Model: Ethnic Pacification in a Nutshell,Roland Benedikter,Jul 19 2021,"Avoiding the return of tribal politics – and political tribes – by institutionalizing group diversity has become one priority in the age of re-globalization and populism. The unique diversity arrangement of the small autonomous area of South Tyrol, in the midst of the European Alps, provides a much sought-after counter-model to the return of political tribalism in the clothes of ethnonationalism. This model of ethnicity-inclusive territorial autonomy is not dependent on the daily goodwill of politicians and citizens as many others are but is institutionalized through the anchorage in the national Italian constitution and thus has the ability to impose “tolerance by law”.The international framework could not be more timely to make this model an example. The current trend of re-nationalization favors the return of mono-narratives of identity and ethnic belonging not only in Europe but on a global scale. Yet Europe, as the continent which over the past half-century has found some of the most successful models of politically and juridically arranging ethnic diversity and cultural difference, is particularly challenged by such a trend. Combined with populism and “state capturing” by groups and parties, re-nationalization favors a transnational resurgence of “tribal politics” combined with the rhetoric of “political tribalism” that threatens ethnic coexistence, especially in European border regions between different nation-states where pluricultural settings are the norm and not the exception.Political tribalism in Europe is increasingly spurred by and enacted through – sometimes artificial – the renaissance of ethnic-nationalisms of different scales, levels, and quality. It can be observed in border regions such as, for example, the region between Flanders and Wallonia (Belgium), the area between Spain and France (the Basque region), the Catalan region (Spain), the eastern regions of Ukraine (Ukraine-Russia), the Chechnya region, the Nagorno-Karabakh area or the regions of the Hungarian minorities in adjacent nations (Hungary-Romania, Hungary-Serbia, Hungary-Slovakia). The embodiment of tribal politics in the clothes of ethnonationalism however often occurs for tactical reasons that serve specific interests rather than the well-being of the ethnic groups involved. It tends to reduce peaceful coexistence, not least by harming narratives of integration that took decades to be implemented.Seen overall, scholars such as Jerry Z. Muller (Muller 2008) and Amy Chua (Chua 2018a, Chua 2018b) have rightly pointed out that the current interweaving between the return of political tribalism and regressive ethnonationalism could be a defining moment in the current historical passage of European (and Western) open societies, with broad long-term socio-political ramifications. Political tribalism as ethnonationalism can be exercised on all levels of governance, including the local, regional and national levels; and when it reaches the dimension of transnational relations it can lead to phenomena of spiral regression where regressive social and political patterns mutually affect each other beyond borders, reaching even to threaten the Western liberal order, as practiced since the end of the second world war.Given these mechanisms, the question for those who want to maintain an open system of diversity based on shared values such as ethnic balancing and inter-ethnic participation, cultural interchange, diversity expressed by the rule of law, institutionalized equality, and the “normalization” of narratives of “positivity” with regard to ethic pluralism is: Where are the proven and efficient counter-models to the new tribalism in the clothes of ethnonationalism? Where in particular do we find models that integrate the positive driving forces of ethnicity and “identity politics” into a greater picture of differentiated modernization, scale, and institutionalized group relations while simultaneously firmly rejecting threats to diversity? Models which, last but not least, prove that “identity politics” must never be something negative, as US-theorists like Francis Fukuyama have asserted all too easily in a mostly U.S.-centric view (Fukuyama 2018), but which depend on the historical setting and context, and can in principle be something positive for specific ethnic groups sharing restricted living spaces with other ethnic groups, as it is the norm in Central and Central Easternanswer these questions, one model deserves particular attention: the small autonomous area of South Tyrol in the Central European Alps. Today the area continues to cultivate a special “Consociational Autonomy” (Peterlini 1997; Peterlini 2013) achieved in 1972 that is, in the eyes of many European politicians such as EU Commission (the factual EU government) President Jean-Claude Juncker, “the” European model arrangement of anti-tribal politics oriented towards positively institutionalizing the identity politics of different ethnic groups, yet with an edge. The area of South Tyrol is regarded as the current best model of how a pluri-ethnic and trans-cultural “Europe of regions” could look in the service of the greater European unification project, based not only on goodwill but on legal justice and the rule of law applied to “Cultural Democracy” (Adams and Goldbard 1995; ECHIC 2019). Many Europeans see South Tyrol as a laboratory of a “Europe made of regions”, as an alternative to a Europe of culturally homogenous nation-states. It is regarded as a model of hope particularly at a difficult time of majority-minority relations, as well as “an interesting counter-example to other contested regions, such as Catalonia and Scotland” (Larin and Röggla 2017).As the South Tyrol model is approaching its 50th anniversary in 2022, it is seen by its representatives and international observers as a mature and proven model of shared and joint ethnic emancipation based on the institutionalized relationship between groups that is extended to the rights of individuals within the framework of a far-reaching territorial autonomy. Yet can this model continue to grow to the high expectations of leading European statesmen, who see it as “the” example of how Europe can grow together by integrating different languages, historic remembrances, socio-political founding myths, and cultures by combining group and individual identity processes through the overarching and integrating narrative of “Autonomy Patriotism”? This term was coined since 2016 by South Tyrol’s autonomous governor Arno Kompatscher (Winkler 2018; Nindler and Mitterwachauer 2018; UnserTirol24.com 2018) as a “glocalized” variant of German philosopher Jürgen Habermas’ “Constitutional Patriotism” – part of his greater consideration of the possibility of “multiculturalism in the liberal state” (Habermas 1994; Calhoun 2002; Müller 2006).South Tyrol: A post-tribal model to counter the mantra of European regressionOne current mantra in the United States goes: “The whole of Europe is on the way to re-nationalization.” Partly true. Yet the whole of Europe? No. A tiny little area withstands the pressure and insists on its unique post-national, pluri-ethnic, and post-tribal arrangement: South Tyrol in the Italian Central European Alps, located in the midst of Switzerland, Austria, and Italy.Since 1972, the small border region of South Tyrol in Northern Italy with its three traditional ethnic groups – Austrian, Italian and Raetoroman (Ladin) – has developed and continuously expanded a special territorial autonomy arrangement with the idea of building an institutional bridge between the German- and Italian-speaking worlds as a constituent part of the European process of reordering and restructuring through transnational pacification and unification, including the institution of territorial autonomies for ethnic minorities. The special South Tyrol autonomy model proves that the fate of European diversity will continue to not only be decided by the micro-politics of equality and participation and by managing the cultural and ethnic traits of migration but also by legal group arrangements regulating multi-ethnicity by imposing the concept of “Tolerance by law” (Pföstl s.a.; Woelk, Palermo and Marko 2008). The South Tyrol model of territorial autonomy indicates that a positive alternative to tribal politics and the return of ethnonationalism is possible, a model that simultaneously integrates their potential underlying positive driving forces, as far asmost important: The South Tyrol model has the advantage of working under proven and real-life conditions and 50 years of practical down-to-earth experience. It provides a bridge between post-tribal, ethnic, group- and pluricultural arrangements, including a non-exclusive secular identity concept related to the territory which could become exemplary for the greater European unification concept, and perhaps even for the upcoming need for greater inter-civilizational joint identity building in a world that is getting smaller and where different people are living in closer proximity to each other every day.“The best model of ethnic pacification in Europe”: A short overviewSouth Tyrol is a tiny area in the Italian Central Alps in the midst of Italy, Switzerland, and Austria with a population of around 550,000 people. Since the start of the 20th century, three different historic ethnic groups have been living mixed together on its territory, in a tight space where they literally can’t escape from each other: the Austrian minorities of German and Raetoroman (Ladin) speakers (68 percent and 4 percent respectively), and the Italian national population (28 percent). (These figures exclude non-national citizens, who in 2018 made up around an additional 15%.) In order to pacify their former ethnic conflicts, a model of “tolerance by law” has been developed which has now proven its efficiency over almost five decades. Indeed, according to EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker (ANSA 2016), “South Tyrol today is the best model of ethnic conflict pacification and intercultural integration in Europe”. According to Juncker, this includes a model role with regard to the post-national and post-tribal “Europeanization” of traditional cultural identities. Although the South Tyrol model of how to deal with ethnic diversity by means of a legal arrangement anchored in the national Italian constitution might initially sound complex due to its high level of differentiation, it is worth looking at it in detail so that it may serve as an example for other cases of cultural and ethnic conflicts that need to be solved.To start with the basics: the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol features an independent legislative model of regional government and self-government that is firmly established in the Italian Constitution and secured by international agreements and EU supervision. Since 1972, departing from its origins in the protection of ethnic minorities, this model has established itself through various successive phases of development as a wide-ranging territorial autonomy in the service of all three main ethnic groups living on the territory.The main aim of the South Tyrol autonomy was initially to protect the German- and Ladin-speaking Austrian minorities in Italy through the legally prescribed participation in the territorial autonomous government of all three main ethnic groups resident in the area: German-, Ladin- and Italian-speakers. The South Tyrol model of “tolerance by law” also included from the beginningthe retention of a high percentage of the taxes levied in the province which is then assigned in proportion to the population groups, for instance by cultural and schooling sector;the equality of languages before the court;and the prescription of multilingualism for all public officials by law.Due to its success, which made the initially poor autonomous area now one of the wealthiest in Europe, over the past decades the South Tyrol model has often been discussed by organizations such as the United Nations (UN) and International Policy Institutes as a model for the solution of ethnic conflicts in other settings, including the Post-Soviet Space (Mikhelidze and Tocci 2012), East Ukraine, West Sahara, Chechnya, and Tibet. This is why the Dalai Lama, for example, with the intention of getting a similar arrangement for Tibet from China, sent his own study groups over decades to the South Tyrol province’s capital, Bozen-Bolzano, to study the South Tyrol model of autonomous self-governance and self-administration at the province’s main think-tank Eurac Research (Eurac Research 2019).complex historical backgroundThe South Tyrol autonomy builds on a complex history of ethnic conflict, as is the case in many places in Europe, particularly in former or current border regions and areas where ethnic and cultural minorities live closely together with national majorities (Gyinesi 2018; Alber and Zwilling 2016). Until the end of the first world war (1918) South Tyrol, along with what is now the Austrian province of Tyrol in the adjacent north and the Italian province of Trentino in the south, formed the “Tyrol Heartland” of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg monarchy (Österreichische Mediathek 2000).Ninety-five percent of the province’s inhabitants were culturally Austrian, with German as their native tongue (Leidlmair 1958). Following the dissolution of the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the first world war, the southern part of Tyrol was annexed by Italy with the treaty of St. Germain in 1919, against the will of the population. Three years later (1922) Benito Mussolini and Italian Fascism came to power, which was hostile to all cultural diversity. Focusing on national “homogenization”, Mussolini began to Italianize the annexed territory using systematic and organized violence (Steininger 1995-2011).The methods employed – besides murder, abduction, and systematic intimidation – were an Italianization policy through mass immigration with the artificial settlement of more than 100,000 Italians within just a few years, abolishing Austrian place names and replacing them with Italian names randomly fabricated by fascist Ettore Tolomei within just a few summer months. Mussolini’s methods also included banning German-speaking school lessons and the German language in public offices and court, partly also in public. It went so far that in many cases even the Austrian names on gravestones were replaced by artificially Italianized names. Through a megalomaniac building program, the provincial capital Bozen (German), now Bolzano (Italian), was conceived by Fascism as “the” fascist model city in the heart of Europe, close to the German-speaking world. After Italianizing its name, the most famous fascist architects intended to make Bozen “the” example of what fascism was capable of, adding a victory monument, including a patriotic “altar”, and a statue of Mussolini “Il Duce” himself to watch over the local population. They planned to raze the original Austrian city to the ground and replace it from scratch with fascist monumental architecture. If Hitler had his model city of Linz (Austria), Mussolini’s “perfect” and “total” dream city of the future was not Rome, but a completely renewed and Italianized Bozen-Bolzano (Obermair 2017).In the 1910 census, the last before the first world war and the beginning of fascist Italianization politics, there were 17,339 Italian-speaking inhabitants registered in South Tyrol (2.9% of the population). The Italian population grew rapidly in the 1930s, when within a few years thousands of industrial workers were artificially settled, although South Tyrol historically had no mentionable industry. Sadly, in the years following the end of the second world war in 1945, the former Fascist Italianization politics continued with the artificial import of Italian migrants, now at the hands of Italy’s first democratic government. It reached its peak in 1961 with 34.3% of the population. Since then the Italian percentage of the population has decreased slightly but is holding steady at around 28%.After the defeat of national socialism and fascism and the end of the second world war (1945), representatives from South Tyrol and the provisional Austrian government began to work on the national reintegration of South Tyrol with Austria. The allies rejected these efforts mainly for military-strategic reasons, despite the demand for a referendum put forward by 80% of the population, and despite massive demonstrations. Italy was now part of the Western alliance and a strategically important factor in the dispute that was starting with the Soviet Union. Austria, on the other hand, was occupied by the Soviets and faced an unknown future between East and West. An argument escalated between Austria and Italy over the status of South Tyrol and who it belonged to (Steininger 1995-2011).The only way to resolve the dispute was now through direct negotiations between both countries over an exemplary compromise: wide-ranging autonomous self-regulation for South Tyrol within the framework of Austria’s role as “protecting power”, while still belonging to Italy. On September 5, 1946, the so-called “Paris Treaty” was signed by the Foreign Ministers of Austria and Italy, Karl Gruber and Alcide Degasperi. Through its own laws and decrees, the province’s original Austrian population would be guaranteed equality of the German language with the Italian language in all public matters as well as the preservation of its culture, ethnic customs, andthe following years, however, Italy did not fulfill its obligations of the Paris Treaty. The province of South Tyrol was incorporated into a greater region, the Autonomous Region of Trentino-South Tyrol, where the Italian population was in the majority, overriding the Austrian minority’s rights to autonomy. The key issue was that the South Tyrol province had no sufficient sub-autonomy within the autonomous region. At the same time, Italianization politics continued with robust residential construction and immigration. This led to civil war-like unrest at the end of the 1950s. Therefore, in September 1959, the then Austrian Foreign Minister, Bruno Kreisky, brought the so-called “South Tyrol Question” before the UN Security Council in New York. At the same time ethnically and nationalistically motivated secession efforts increased. In 1961 pro-Austrian separatists carried out a series of bomb attacks to try to reunify South Tyrol with Austria by force, with 37 attacks in the night of 10-11 June 1961 alone, the so-called “South Tyrol Night of Fire”(Südtiroler Feuernacht) (Steininger 1995-2011).Negotiations between Italy and Germany were subsequently intensified and soon reached a provisional, amicable conclusion. A better solution for provincial autonomy was found, which provided that South Tyrol should gradually attain wide-ranging self-government in the form of a strongly developed sub-autonomy within the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tyrol, while at the same time remaining both parts of this region and the nation-state of Italy. This solution for provincial autonomy was supported on 23 November 1969 by the ethnic-cultural “collective party” (Sammelpartei) of South Tyroleans of Austrian cultural origin (i.e. German- and Ladin-speakers) founded in 1946, the South Tyrolean People’s Party (SVP). This support nevertheless was achieved only after serious internal disputes which brought the party to the brink of breaking apart, since around half of its representatives were of the opinion that a clear split and return of the province to Austria in the framework of the right of self-determination (UNPO 2017a; UNPO 2017b; Danspeckgruber 2002;Danspeckgruber 2017) as coined by 20th-century political leaders such as Lenin, Wilson, Roosevelt and Churchill and later adapted by the United Nations Charter (United Nations 1945) would be preferable. The solution of a far-reaching provincial autonomy for South Tyrol within the Italian national state was subsequently also endorsed by the Italian and Austrian governments. In 1972 the so-called “new” or “second” Autonomy Statute came into force which – and this remains exemplary internationally to the present day – is a constitutional law of the Italian Republic and can only be changed with a 2/3 majority vote of the national Parliament, and with the international agreement of the European Union under the auspices of the UN.Over the following 20 years, from 1972 to 1992, these legal foundations were managed by Italy little by little with some tough wrestling at times between South Tyrol’s ruling SVP party, i.e. the (formally) meta-ideological representative of South Tyrol’s Austria-stemming minorities, the “protecting power” Austria and rapidly changing governments in Rome. Since the provincial autonomy started to guarantee South Tyrol effective self-management in some of the most important “identities” areas such as culture and schooling, in 1992 there was a declaration of dispute resolution by mutual agreement between Austria and Italy. Consent from the Austrian minority ethnic collective party, the SVP, for this declaration followed after a formal diplomatic note, in which Italy delivered its official report on the implementation of the South Tyrol provincial Autonomy Statute, making explicit reference to the Paris Treaty of 1946 and thus ensuring that any breach of the agreement remained actionable before international judicial authorities.Since then, the declaration of dispute resolution has marked a provisional conclusion to the South Tyrol dispute, although the autonomy regulation for the province is still developing dynamically in terms of application, scope, legitimacy, public involvement, and self-identity. Recent reforms of the Italian constitution, among others initiated by the government of premier Matteo Renzi (2014-16), have, however, put some question marks on aspects of it, making adaptations necessary. The exact extent of such modifications remains open due to the repeated delay and postponement of Italian national systemic reforms (Eurac Monitoring Centre on Autonomies 2019; Benedikter 2016; Woelk, Palermo and Markodiversity, the South Tyrolean waySumming up, the key to pacification was the implementation of the so-called “Second Autonomy Statute”, a kind of special sub-constitution anchored in Italy’s national constitution, in 1972. Since then, as mentioned, a “dynamic autonomy” has been practiced, meaning that the autonomous province subsequently gained power. In 1992, the declaration of the end of hostilities between Austria and Italy made the province definitely “the” example of how the institutionalization of different ethnocultural and ethnohistoric diversity can be fruitful to pacify ethnic identity conflicts in Europe through “tolerance by law”, i.e. by means of a far-reaching self-administration including partial financial, political and educational autonomies for the ethnic groups represented in the province’s autonomous parliament. This remains de facto independent of the autonomous region’s joint parliament of the two provinces Trentino and South Tyrol, which together constitute the autonomous region of Trentino-South Tyrol.Seen from the current view, the decisive aspect of South Tyrol’s special arrangement is that its autonomy is consociational to its core (Peterlini 2009; Peterlini 2013). Among other regulations, all three ethnic groups must be included by law in the autonomous provincial government. As mentioned, public money and offices are distributed among the ethnic groups according to census percentages – the so-called “proportional” system. It means that in principle an ethnic group gets money for its specific purposes (such as culture or schooling) according to its share in the population living on the territory. There are three different school systems allowing for every ethnic group to have public education for free in their own mother tongue. Yet every citizen is free to send their children to any school they want to. Many Italians nowadays send their children to German-speaking public schools, creating the paradoxical situation that in some cases there are more native Italian speakers in German-speaking schools (meant for the preservation of the language and culture of the Austrian German-speaking minority) than native German speakers. Given that all citizens on the territory have to speak at least two languages to access public posts, this prevents the Italianization or Germanization of the public administration.Most important: the benefits of autonomy are shared, with all citizens living in stability on the territory, transforming the initially ethnically motivated autonomy arrangement de facto from an ethnic to territorial autonomy. This benefits the Austrian-stemming minorities and the Italian national population living on the territory equally, and in this sense, there is no difference between the rights and duties of minorities and majorities living in the area.Such systemic consociationalism which simultaneously unifies and differentiates the needs of the three main ethnic groups has led to the peaceful coexistence of previously conflicting identities. The result is that the province of South Tyrol, one of the poorest areas in Central Europe at the end of the second world war, has transformed into one of Europe’s most prosperous areas, socially and economically.Aspects of critiqueNevertheless, critics have pointed out that such institutionalization of ethnic-cultural differentiation may have the negative effect of hindering the development of a joint overarching identity, as well as preventing the emergence of a more fluid concept of territorial “trans-locality” (Guelke 2012). In addition, South Tyrol’s special arrangement since the 2000s and particularly since Europe’s refugee and migration crisis since 2015 faces the new challenge of strong non-EU immigration, which is creating a situation of traditionally-local (“old”) versus incoming-global (“new”) minorities (Carlà 2018) of very different identity patterns, including, in particular, cultural and religious differences causing fears of discontinuity in the system (Rautz 2015; Rautz 2017). Additionally, the ethnic identities on which the South Tyrolean model has been based are challenged by continuing individualization and “glocalization”, i.e. the trend towards the dissolution of ethnic belonging and territorial binding, which is also a trend in the development of European Union law. It is rarely explicitly considered that a large part of the migration, particularly to the Alpine mountainous zones which are to some extent detached from the urban centres of attraction, is forced migration, with different causes and driving forces still to be fully understood in both the origins and effects (Membretti, Dematteis and Di Gioia 2018).While some believe that the solution is a new, more “neutral” European meta-identity concept where each and everybody conceives themselves as “minorities” and where there are no more majorities in perception at all, creating a basic attitude to which some Central Eastern and Eastern European areas were used to for centuries (“subcutaneous identities”), others point out that the future of the term “consociational” in Europe may rather lie in a balance between – and in the ideal case integration of – both ethnic and meta-ethnicfrom such a viewpoint, the territory-centered approach of “Autonomy Patriotism” (Winkler 2018; Nindler and Mitterwachauer 2018; UnserTirol24.com 2018) could become a new, programmatically transcultural – and inclusively meta-ethnic, yet non-culture-neutralizing – the concept of civil religion dedicated to implementing an overarching secular sense of belonging to a territory, while not reacting aggressively against more traditional ethnic identity concepts, rather including them in a greater joint vision. In essence, such meta-ethnic identity in the sense of “autonomy patriotism” would be explicitly not conceived as non-ethnic or post-cultural identity. Its main aim must be to pave the way for a greater European identity concept of “unity in diversity” – with both poles “unity” and “diversity” in continued and stable balance – following the outline of the EU motto “Unity in diversity”. “Unity in diversity” is, for the time being, not a path towards a specific goal or final space, nor to a precisely circumscribed, explicit identity concept (Karolewski 2016), but rather a levitation concept, with an open outcome.Implications and perspectivesIn recent years, the South Tyrolean autonomy has been regarded as an exemplary response to questions of tension between re-nationalization and re-localization, which seems to have become one of the core conditions to be dealt with in the greater European context. South Tyrol’s developing administrative and governmental cooperation bonds with the Austrian Tyrol province in the north and the Italian Trentino province in the south aim to create a trans-border region called the “European Region of Tyrol”, which in the future could include certain joint governmental decisions. The “European Region of Tyrol” is regarded by many as an exemplary transnational model of how a united Europe could work by the means of denationalization and regionalization. In the coming years, the concept of “Autonomy Patriotism” coined by South Tyrol’s governor Arno Kompatscher (Nindler and Mitterwachauer 2018) could also be applied to this greater framework. Since 2017 a debate has been running over the issuing of dual Austrian-Italian passports for members of South Tyrol’s German and Ladin ethnic groups. The question is if this may help the transnational unification and “Autonomy Patriotism” or not.It would be reductionist and too much of a simplification to say that the South Tyrol model overcomes the negative sides of tribalism by keeping and valorizing its positive aspects. Rather, this model suggests that as a trans- and to a certain extent meta-cultural and pluri-ethnic model of territorial belonging it does not believe in the supremacy of culture over politics. On the contrary, the concept of “Autonomy Patriotism” tries to balance both, without privileging one at the cost of the other. If there is currently a revival of the Gramsci tradition both on the left and right wings of populism (Benedikter 2017) interpreting culture as the prerequisite of politics (BBC radio on populism) and thus implicitly making the case for a revival of culture (and ideology) both within politics and as a means of politics with a particular trend toward populist positions, the South Tyrol model suggests the opposite: that politics can valorize and at the same time master cultural differences, including ethnic ones.In turn, since South Tyrol is considered a European model region of ethnic and transnational integration, it is and remains more dependent on the European unification project than other regions and territories. While after decades of efforts South Tyrol feels in many ways more European than surrounding spaces such as East Switzerland, Northern Tyrol or Trentino, it is in turn also more affected by European and global developments. For example, South Tyrol currently seems to have become the main target of Chinese investment, since the area is located directly on the south-north passage of the so-called New Silk Road between the port of Trieste, a strategic goal of China’s investment initiative, and Munich, one of its main destinations. At the same time, South Tyrol remains among the few dozen wealthiest European regions precisely because of its territorial autonomy, which remains one of the farthest-reaching and most efficient in European history for the benefit of all citizens on the territory. To further develop the model, both continued participation “from below” through involving the civil society comprising all ethnic groups, and constant “ethnographic repair work” must be implemented as a never-ending process.OutlookAll in all, South Tyrol’s consociational autonomy is a post-national model arrangement of multiethnicity, pluriculturally, and European diversity management, in a nutshell, enacted through “tolerance by law”, currently developing toward the overarching identity concept of “Autonomy Patriotism”. Its decades-long evolutionary history can serve as a storehouse of experience for other multi-lingual and transnational experiments with diversity and difference. Yet it is just one – quite specific – model among others, and it presents its pros and cons like all other approaches. Given that history is and remains a superhuman process made by humans, which cannot be completely mastered, but just influenced, as much as possible, by rational and humanistic considerations following the teachings or the enlightenment tradition, politics can only be optimistic, although it cannot control everything. This remains true also for European diversity and complexity management as a whole. It remains true in particular for the socio-culturally and socio-politically often over-complex pluricultural and multi-ethnic environments in Europe, which are partly also specific to Europe and present profoundly different characteristics compared to the ethnic and identity questions in other parts of the world, for example in the United States, central China or Russia.Parts of this text are based on the official information on the South Tyrol Autonomy model provided by the Autonomous Government of South Tyrol, for example at: “This is South Tyrol”, accessed 16 July 2021, and earlier versions and editions.Figure 1: South Tyrol – Image by TUBS/Wikimedia Commons"

The People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the largest claimant in the region has resorted to a wide range of means to justify and consolidate its claims in the disputed region, from the reclamation work on the features it occupies to the issuance of several official documents presenting evidence of its historical connections to the South China Sea. However, there is one legal avenue that seems to have been under-exploited for the PRC, and that is the 1952 Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Officially the PRC denies the validity of this treaty but to an ambiguous extent it still refers to the content of this treaty to justify its legitimacy in the South China Sea. The purpose of this article is to present the reasons why this treaty might be potentially helpful to the PRC’s claim and explain why its attitude towards the treaty has largely been hesitant so far.To understand the potential usefulness of the treaty and the reasons behind its seemingly under-exploitation, a brief look at the history between 1946 to 1952 is necessary because these tumultuous years formed the basis for such paradoxical situation. After the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, China was occupied by two main political parties respectively: the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Kuomintang (KMT). The two parties fought a bloody civil war and the result was that the CCP dominated the mainland China while the remnants of the KMT moved its regime, the Republic of China (ROC), to the island of Taiwan. In the following years after 1949, both sides claimed to be the only legitimate government for the whole China, which four decades later led to a “92 Consensus” stipulating that there is only “One China” between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. But diplomatically at that time some countries, for example the United States (US), continued to recognise the KMT as the legitimate government of the China, while others, for example the United Kingdom, moved its recognition from the KMT to the CCP.Internationally, the San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed between Japan and 48 other countries on 8 September 1951. The purpose of this treaty was to officially end the Second World War between the Allies and Japan and to make post-war arrangements in the Asia-pacific region. The Article 2 of the San Francisco Peace Treatyincludes all the territories renounced by Japan, including Korea, Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores (Penghu), the Kurile Islands, Pacific Islands formerly under mandate to Japan, any part of the Antarctic area, and the Spratlys and the Paracels. But the treaty was signed with neither the presence of the CCP or the KMT. The reason was that there was disagreement over which party could properly represent the central government of China.In practice, the CCP and the KMT took very different approaches to the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The CCP denies the legitimacy of the San Francisco Peace Treaty outright on the ground that it was excluded from the negotiation process. On 18 September 1951, PRC Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai announced its rejection of this treaty. Zhou talked about the absence of the PRC delegates in the negotiation and criticized the US’ intention to re-arm Japan. The conclusion was that the treaty was illegal, invalid and could not be recognized.The KMT, in contrast, decided to sign a separate treaty with Japan that inherited the main ideas in the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1952. It was believed that the motive behind this move was to avoid offending its key ally, the United States. The new treaty, which was made more applicable to the ROC’s circumstances, became what was known as the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Officially the CCP denied the legitimacy of this treaty as well. Zhou Enlai claimed that the treaty “public insults and is hostile to the Chinesedespite this, the 1952 Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty is strongly linked to the sovereignty status of the Spratlys and the Paracels in the South China Sea, which can favour China’s interest if properly used. Taiwanese scholars have made attempts to present their cases which are plausible and reasonable to a certain extent. Chen Hurng-yu’s “Territorial Disputes in the South China Sea under the San Francisco Peace Treaty” and Lin Man-houng’s “A Neglected Treaty for the South China Sea” are two examples of such efforts. In both articles, two points are particularly highlighted.First, they compare the differences between the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the 1952 Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty and find that the territorial issues mentioned in the latter must have indicated that these territories in the South China Sea were transferred to the ROC. The Article 2 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty includes all the territories renounced by Japan, including Korea, Formosa (Taiwan) and the Pescadores (Penghu), the Kurile Islands, Pacific Islands formerly under mandate to Japan, any part of the Antarctic area, and the Spratlys and the Paracels. However, the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty does not mention as many. It only includes Taiwan and Penghu as well as the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands. Why does the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty only mention these areas instead of all the areas renounced by Japan?The most natural explanation is that these territories are highly relevant to the Republic of China, more than any military or geopolitical sense. Militarily and strategically, the Korean peninsula is relevant to China’s interest, but it is not mentioned in the Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty. Therefore, the Spratlys and the Paracels must have been interpreted in a way with strong territorial implications to the ROC. Lin quotes a historical document which reveals that although the UK discouraged the ROC from participating in the San Francisco Conference, it insisted that the bilateral treaty’s application scope should be limited to the territory that was then and would later be under the control of the ROC. Lin also discovers that on 27 May 1952 Eiji Wajima, Japanese Director-General of the Asian Affairs Bureau, explained at the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the Upper House that of the territories included in the San Francisco Peace Treaty, those closely related to the ROC were mentioned in the bilateral treaty again. Chen’s article also focuses on this point. He refers to an explanation offered by Daniel Dzurek who argued that: “This shows that the ROC and Japan viewed the islands of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys, and the Paracels as having similar status – that is, belonging to China.”Ma Ying-jeou became a professor in Soochow University after he stepped down as the President of the ROC and he supplemented the importance of the treaty with his evidence. He referred to the Exchange of "

The permanent International Criminal Court (ICC), established in 2002, now consists of 123 member states covering almost the entire globe. Most national criminal codes have integrated major elements of international criminal law, making core international crimes (namely, genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes) punishable. From the peace process and the on-going conflicts in the Middle East, it is difficult to avoid discussions regarding accountability for international crimes in situations of mass violence.Behind this prominence of international criminal justice as a practice lies the idea that individuals should be held criminally accountable for committing atrocities, sometimes referred to as the ‘norm of anti-impunity’ (Bower 2019). A key feature of the anti-impunity norm is the idea that all individuals, regardless of their power or official role, should be held accountable if they are responsible for committing the core international crime. The image of powerful political and military leaders on the dock—as it was the case in the post-World War Two International Military Tribunals of Nuremberg and Tokyo—certainly dominates the public’s imagination about international criminal justice. State officials, such as the Head of State, have traditionally been provided immunity from criminal prosecution under international law as an extension of the principle of sovereign equality. This ‘sovereign immunity’ has increasingly been chipped away with the development of international criminal law (ICL), which has removed sovereign immunity as a protection from criminal prosecution for core international crimes. For example, Article 27 (1) of the Rome Statute of the ICC states that the Statute “shall apply equally to all persons without any distinction based on official capacity. In particular, official capacity as a Head of State or Government “[…] shall in no case exempt a person from criminal responsibility under this Statute […].”Nevertheless, prosecution of high-ranking state officials, particularly Heads of State, remain deeply controversial in practice. When the ICC charged then-President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir for war crimes and genocide, for example, this precipitated a decade-long crisis between the ICC and African states (Mills, 2012). Sovereignty remains a powerful norm, particularly for weaker states of the international system (Garcia Iommi, 2020), and in practical terms, the ICC remains reliant on state cooperation for its operations, allowing Heads of States and other powerful actors to successfully push back against efforts to hold them accountable for atrocities (Han, 2019). Such opposition to holding Heads of State accountable have been seen as a direct challenge to the legitimacy and strength the norm of anti-impunity (Mills and Bloomfield, 2018; Boehme, 2017; Garcia Iommi, 2020).But what exactly is the place of sovereign immunity (or its eradication) in the norm of anti-impunity? What significance does it hold in the practice of international criminal justice? The following analytical essay will introduce a theoretical framework to conceptualise the relationship between the anti-impunity norm and sovereign immunity. This draws on a previously published essay, co-authored with Sophie T. Rosenberg (LSE) on the normative significance of the African Union’s contestation against the ICC, titled “Claiming Equality: The African Union’s Contestation of the Anti-Impunity Norm,” appearing in International Studies Review.The Internal Structure ofare commonly conceptualised in IR theory as shared understandings that define standards of appropriate behaviour—in other words, ideas of what ‘ought’ to be done (Checkel 1999, Finnemore and Sikkink 1998). While earlier generations of Constructivist IR research assumed that the meanings of norms were fixed in their studies of how norms diffuse, become institutionalised, and ultimately become ‘taken for granted’ by actors (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998), increasing focus on the contestation of norms (e.g.Stimmer and Wisken 2019) led to a broader questioning of whether norms can have fixed meanings in the first place (Niemann and Schillinger 2017). Critical constructivists thus argued that norms should be understood as having a dual quality as being simultaneously stable and flexible, as they are socially constructed through actors’ interaction in a given context (Wiener, 2008). A norm’s meaning, in other words, is constructed ‘in-use’ (ibid).To better theoretically capture this duality of norms as both stable and flexible, it is necessary to unpack the internal structure of norms. Winston (2018) proposes a three-part structure of a norm in this vein, which can be expressed in this conditional statement: “given this problem, my value dictates this behaviour.” For example, consider the norm ‘civilians should not be killed during war.’ A simple understanding of norms as dictating what ‘ought’ to be done would only focus on the behaviour: we should not kill civilians. The tripartite structure of norms (referred to Winston as a ‘norm cluster’), on the other hand, is highlighting the fact that the dictum ‘do not kill civilians’ only make sense as an appropriate behaviour if we accept that we hold certain values (such as, the sanctity of life) and identify a problem in relation to these values (such as, protecting the sanctity of life in war). Winston argues that these individual normative elements of value, problem, and behaviour may be combined in a variety of ways as long as the different configurations (the “meaning-in-use” emerging from each context) are considered to be legitimate by the wider community (Winston, 2018). The insight here is that there can be multiple values that dictate a single behaviour, and conversely, commitment to a single value claim can result in different behavioural prescriptions.Unpacking the Anti-Impunity NormApplying Winston’s conceptualisation of norms, existing understandings of the anti-impunity norm as the ‘criminal prosecution of individuals for atrocities’ in effect assume a singular behaviour (prosecution of all alleged perpetrators) to a problem (impunity), identified by a unified set of values (universality of human rights). From this perspective, it is quite clear that sovereign immunity needs to be pulled back fully. But looking at the principles of ICL shown in statutes and judgements of international criminal tribunals and their practices, the anti-impunity norm’s internal structure is far more complex. Specifically, the idea that individuals should be held criminally accountable for atrocities is underpinned by different values, producing different sets of behavioural prescriptions.Value(s) of the Anti-Impunity NormThere are three distinct, if intertwined value claims at the heart of the anti-impunity norm we see in practice today. The first can be expressed as the principle of individual legal equality, or the idea that individuals have equal rights and responsibilities in the eyes of the law, as enshrined by international human rights (Nouwen, 2012). Impunity becomes a problem from this perspective as it implies that some people are not granted the same degree of protection from international law, while others are able to shirk from their responsibility.The second value claim is the principle of sovereign equality of states. While ICL has been understood as enhancing the principle of individual equality at the expense of sovereign equality (Teitel, 2011), in practice, international criminal justice is a result of a more ambiguous compromise between individual and sovereign equality. The ICC’s jurisdiction does not automatically apply to all individuals, as it may be expected if we were to prioritise the value of individual equality, but only to member states who consented to the Statute. The Court is also set up as a ‘court of last resort’ through the principle of complementarity, which stipulates that it can only intervene if a state is unable or unwilling to prosecute, or by the invitation of the state itself (Gissel, 2018). This privileged position of states in the architecture of the ICC (Han, 2019), highlights how individual equality is pursued within broader principles of sovereign equality, rather than replacingthird and final value claim is the principle of equality of accountability, or the value placed on the impartial application of the anti-impunity norm. A legitimate legal system, including that of international criminal justice, is a system in which justice is meted out even-handedly (Cryer, 2005), irrespective of political or social power. Impunity is a problem from the principle of equality of accountability in two ways. First, it can indicate that individuals are being held accountable selectively, particularly if people with less power are being held accountable more regularly. Second, it can indicate that atrocities committed within and by powerful states are not being held accountable for their actions. The negotiation history of the ICC suggests that this second aspect of equality of accountability was particularly important for weaker states of the international system, whose pursuit of anti-impunity was geared towards solving the problem of impunity enjoyed by powerful state actors (Gissel, 2018).Three Principles of Equality and Sovereign ImmunityThe behavioural prescription that sovereign immunity should be removed, thus, need to be evaluated in light of these three principles of equality: between individuals, between sovereigns, and in terms of the general application of ICL. A version of the anti-impunity norm that prioritises individual equality over all other values, for example, may dictate that sovereign immunity need to be removed from practice fully. There is a logical reason to argue for this version of the anti-impunity norm—as Mills and Bloomfield argue, given that it is often state officials that plan and order atrocities, it would be nonsensical to prevent their prosecution (2018). A similar conclusion would be reached if we were to prioritise securing equality of accountability between individuals. Ability to prosecute politically more powerful individuals would help us act on the value of equal justice in this sense.But in a version of the anti-impunity norm that puts greater emphasis on the value of sovereign equality, sovereign immunity can continue to exist alongside an international norm of anti-impunity without necessarily being a contradiction in terms. Some legal commentators, for example, have argued for respect for sovereign immunity remains essential in the case of arrest warrants for state officials of non-member states of the ICC (Gaeta and Labuda, 2017; Nouwen, 2012).Furthermore, a version of the anti-impunity norm that prioritises the equality of accountability between states may de-prioritise the question of what kind of individual is being held accountable over what country they represent or operate in. In other words, focusing on prosecuting individuals from powerful states could be normatively preferable than concentrating on powerful actors within historically weaker or marginalised states. The question of whether sovereign immunity is preserved or not becomes somewhat less urgent from this version of the anti-impunity norm.Conclusion and ImplicationsWhere does conceptualising the anti-impunity norm as having a composite structure with different value claims (articulated in terms of the three principles of equality above), problem (impunity), and behaviour (which includes, but is not limited to, the repealing of sovereign immunity) get us?Theoretically, conceptualising the anti-impunity norm in this manner helps us think about plural futures for the norm. Black-boxing the internal structure of the norm, particularly the varied values that intersect at its core, pushes us to think about contestation surrounding particular behavioural prescriptions in overly dichotomous terms.For example, based on the assumption that the anti-impunity norm has a singular, fixed meaning, some scholars have seen contestation of the prosecution of Heads of State (and thus protection of sovereign immunity) as something that fundamentally damages the anti-impunity norm (Mills and Bloomfield, 2018), or strengthens other, competing norms in its place (Boehme, 2017), leading to norm weakening or even norm death (Panke and Petersohn, 2012; Kutz, 2014). But if we were to take seriously the idea that norms are simultaneously stable and flexible, ‘taken for granted’ yet ‘essentially contested’, we can better systematically unpack the various “endings” of norm contestation (Stimmer,is not simply a theoretical exercise. A more nuanced and specified understanding of the anti-impunity norm’s internal structure, as the ‘equality claims framework’ in this article presents, can help us better evaluate the normative appropriateness of real-life developments. Despite continued rhetoric of crisis and erosion (Vasilev, 2019), the ICC as an institution is not shuttering its doors anytime soon. Nor is the broader practice of international criminal justice. Rather, we are witnessing changes to the ways in which impunity is addressed, whose crime is being prioritised, and what kind of perpetrators are being targeted. Moving away from the (sole) question of whether the ‘big fish’ are being caught, participants within international criminal justice is asking, what kind of justice is possible to shore up which value claims (Drumbl, 2019). Is impunity a problem because it primarily violates individual legal equality? Or is this particular instance of impunity more egregious because it pertains to a more powerful actor, violating the principle of equality of accountability?The ‘equality claims’ framework presents us with a way to evaluate and understand these competing versions of justice—many of which remain politically, normatively, and emotionally persuasive in real life politics (Clarke, 2019)."

The programmatic for the School distinction between ‘traditional theory’ and ‘critical theory’ was coined by Adorno’s close associate and co-author, Max Horkheimer (1972). The School’s institutional basis, the Institute of Social Research, was set up in 1923 in Frankfurt am Main by the son of an affluent grain merchant, Felix Weil, with the purpose of studying the contradictions of contemporary society from a Marxist standpoint. Not all members of the Institute were Marxists however, and its orientation was interdisciplinary, bringing together social theory, philosophy, psychoanalysis, economics and empirical studies. Under the directorship of Horkheimer, from 1931 onwards, research at the Institute took a decisively philosophical outlook and enlisted figures such as Friedrich Pollock, Leo Lowenthal, Herbert Marcuse, and Erich Fromm (Wiggershaus 1995, 24-105). After Adorno joined Horkheimer as a co-director, the two wrote a series of interventions the best known among which is Dialectic of Enlightenment (1997 [1944]), a work produced in exile in America where the Institute for Social Research was temporarily relocated to avoid Nazi persecution. This article will outline Adorno’s contribution to critical theory by paying attention to the problem of late modernity. In the course of analysis, it will attempt to address the following questions: Why should we read Adorno today? How do his ideas illuminate late modern society? Do they broaden our understanding of current global society?Students of International Relations (IR) usually get acquainted with critical theory via the writings of Jürgen Habermas, a second-generation scholar from the Frankfurt School. While Habermas clearly represents the School’s critical theoretical orientation, his formal connection with the Institute of Social Research had remained tenuous after Horkheimer rejected Habermas’s habilitation project, later published as The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere (1989 [1962]). Thus, the ideas of the first-generation thinkers from the Frankfurt School remain unfamiliar to IR students. Adorno’s views are worth examining not only because of their scope, blending social theory, metaphysics, and aesthetics with a historical critique of late capitalism, but because of their peculiar philosophical sensibility. The ensuing exposition will focus on clarifying Adorno’s critique of late modernity, and on explaining why he ended up diagnosing it as a problem of unfreedom.A new metaphysics?Adorno’s writings are notoriously difficult to decipher. In the English-speaking world the problem has been compounded by underwhelming translations of his major works, including his masterpiece on metaphysics, Negative Dialectics (1973), appearing in the early 1970s shortly after Adorno’s death. Recently his Nachlass, including copious lecture notes, has been published offering us fresh insights into his forbidding philosophical vocabulary. In what follows, a use has been made of Philosophical Elements of a Theory of Society (Adorno 2019) and Metaphysics: Concepts and Problems (Adorno 2001). These lecture notes illuminate the puzzle of why Adorno, whom Iris Murdock described as a ‘philosopher with a zest for metaphysics’ (Adorno 1991, endorsement), rejected traditional metaphysics exemplified by Plato’s Theory of Forms (Adorno 2001, 26-27) and by Heidegger’s ‘fundamental ontology’ (Heidegger 1962 [1927], Part I; Adorno 1973, esp. 97-131). The problem with the first is that it posits a double world, a world of unchanging Forms and a world of contingent appearances, asserting the former’s reality. Heidegger inappropriately assimilates the ontic (the existent) to the ontological (Being), and then renders Being vacuous: ‘The self-uncovering Being says nothing else but “Being”’ (Adorno 1973, 114). Against this, Adorno searches for a new type of metaphysics that would reflect the conclusions of a theory of society, or the social practices constituting a particular society (Adorno 2019, 50), and would have a historical dimension. To understand his position, it is necessary to consider the basic ideas that have been formative for his thought.Major influences on Adorno’smost prominent influence is Hegel. This includes Hegel’s account of reality as mediated by thought (Hegel 1969 [1812]), the dialectical development of institutional forms such as the family, civil society, and the state (Hegel 1967 [1821]), and the theory of historical reason (Hegel 1953 [1837]), as reason revealed in and through such progressively developing forms.The second influence is Jewish mysticism. It is rooted in Adorno’s own Jewish background as well as that of his friend, Walter Benjamin, who was briefly a member of the Institute of Social Research before committing suicide in September 1940 for fear of Nazi detention at the Spanish border. Hannah Arendt happened to travel through the same border check-point a few months later and managed to save and bring to Adorno Benjamin’s final manuscripts including his Theses on the Philosophy of History (Benjamin 1968). In these theses, Benjamin articulates his hope for a messianic future, and his critique of historical progress which has ended up with the gas chambers (Benjamin 1968, 257-258, 260-264). The rise of Fascism and anti-Semitism is a problem that will continue to occupy Adorno as well as Horkheimer in Dialectic of Enlightenment (1997 [1944], 168-208) and in the more empirically orientated Authoritarian Personality (1950). Philosophically this problem reveals that Hegel must have been wrong to claim that reason has a tendency for a dialectical self-correction and that society evolves into ever more progressive historical, political, and cultural forms.Adorno’s metaphysics, then, retains Hegel’s dialectics as a philosophical method but rejects Hegel’s theory of historical development, historical reason, and the state.The third influence on Adorno is Marx’s early theory of alienated labour (Marx 1975). Adorno has never accepted a full-fledged Marxism and remained critical of Marx’s scientism, theory of class struggle, and the vulgar suggestion of an economic base determining the superstructure: the sphere of culture, art and knowledge production. Indeed, one of Adorno’s major contributions to social theory is his thesis that the distortions of late modernity are manifest and reproduced in the realm of the ‘culture industry’ (Adorno 1991a, 1991b, 1991c; Adorno and Horkheimer 1997 [1944], 120-167). This thesis, characteristically, belongs not to a theory of economics, as in Marx, but to a philosophical theory of society, as in Hegel.Late modernity and unfreedom: towards a philosophical theory of societyIn a Hegelian vein, the proposed theory assumes that society forms a ‘totality’ which has no outside. In Philosophical Elements of a Theory of Society, Adorno remarks that the concept of society did not exist until the early eighteenth century, whereas that of the state began with the Stoics in ancient Greece (Adorno 2019, 39). At first this contrast between ‘state’ and ‘society’ may appear fanciful. But it should not be forgotten that, as a Frankfurt School theorist, Adorno has set himself the task of producing a critique of late capitalism—the world of social relations found in the developed world, or crudely ‘the West’, after WWII. Construed in this sense, ‘society’ emerged with the establishment of nascent market relations at the stage of early (industrial) capitalism (Adorno 2019, 24-25). Its structure is not static, as was the case in the Middle Ages. ‘Society’ in Adorno’s usage stands for post-capitalist society marked by dynamics and social mobility expressed in changeable social roles and occupations, and by multiple antagonisms and contradictions—between groups, between group and individual, and between system-wide tasks and individual desires. It is not always easy or even possible to neatly sort out its good from its faulty elements. This type of society therefore can only be understood through an equally complex and contradictory dialectical methodsublimated into a philosophical theory of society (Adorno 2019,present epoch of late modernity has a few core aspects, the most palpable among which is late capitalism. But, as Adorno is at pains to show, the contradictions within late capitalist society are not limited to or fuelled by a class struggle between labour and capital. One reason is that the working class has been co-opted—or ‘integrated’ in sociological terms—by the system due to the attainment of economic affluence (Adorno 2019,38) and the advent of social security programmes and trade unions (Adorno 2019, 27-30). For Adorno, the current social system has the capacity for recruiting individuals for its own purposes which run counter to their true interests as human beings and producers of value. The result is the ‘atomisation’ of social relations among the workers, who no longer exhibit mutual solidarity but turn into competitors (Adorno 2019, 36-37). Marx’s early theory of alienation is easily recognisable in this argument. But there are also key differences. Alienation for Marx is ultimately linked to value in the economist’s sense of the term as related to scarcity and market exchange (Joseph 2003, 131). For Adorno, ‘value’ has a broader sense—it may include aesthetic value attached to the experience of a beautiful art object. In general, in late modernity the possibilities for the appreciation of value have been deflated because we, as individuals, have fewer and fewer options to choose from and to enact ourselves as free agents.Adorno’s diagnosis of late modernity is that it constitutes a condition of unfreedom. The leitmotiv of Dialectic of Enlightenment is that freedom is threatened because of a certain trend of dehumanisation and regress, which paradoxically—or dialectically—is the unintended outcome of the progress initially associated with the Enlightenment. The main theme of Dialectic is ‘the self-destructiveness of Enlightenment’ (Adorno and Horkheimer 1997 [1944], xi). But what exactly is Enlightenment? What are its core aspects, and is there a possibility for redemption? Adorno and Horkheimer use the term ‘Enlightenment’ to designate a set of concepts. In one sense, it means the historical epoch of the European Enlightenment. In another, conceptual (non-historical) sense it stands for ‘reason’ or ratio, an idea going back to Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle held that reason guides us towards worthy ends, whereas the modern, post-Baconian conception of reason is purely instrumental: it deals with means being indifferent to the ends (Adorno 2019, 89-92, 102, 112-114). But instrumental reason was used to construct the gas chambers to speed up the liquidation of the German Jews. The institutional vehicle which sustains instrumental reason is modern science, commencing with Bacon’s writings in the early seventeenth century. ‘Enlightenment’ in a third sense refers to this image of modern science.The two further aspects of late modernity for Adorno are scientism and rationalism, which constitute the negative or corrosive aspects of Enlightenment. The first represents an exaggerated belief in technical rationality based on science as a value-free, quantification-based mode of inquiry. The second is the related belief that all societal problems can be resolved by the proper use of reason. Reason, once again, stands for instrumental reason devoid of ethical ends. This portrait of society is anticipated by Foucault (1995)—it involves the use of averages, percentages and statistical tendencies to classify, order and steer human conduct.Patients are not seen as concrete individuals but as medical ‘cases’, employees are ‘human resources’ and so on. This generates an abstract view of society, which gets reified into a thing standing over and against the individual, and inside which people no longer find room for concrete, living experience (Adorno 2019, 48-49).In short, in late modernity reason has turned against itself. Enlightenment was supposed to deploy reason in order to free humanity from fear, superstition, and to ensure control over the blind forces of nature. But at the end reason has become instrumentalised to such an extent that it regresses into unreason and irrationality. In the twentieth century, the vilest manifestation of irrationality at the level of social systems is Fascism where the state begins to exterminate its own citizens. Similar is the gloomy record of violence and oppression in the Stalinist states. The point is that this kind of predatory social system descends from the Enlightenment’s project of reason (O’Sullivanculture industryAnd yet, for Adorno, Fascism is simultaneously a product of late capitalism which, together with scientism and rationalism, represents the third core aspect of late modernity. Late capitalism is monopoly capitalism coupled with an interventionist state, which regularly intervenes into the economy to ensure sufficient employment (Adorno 1987; 2019, 28-29). This prevents any economic immiseration of the proletariat, but the problem does not disappear—it reappears in the cultural sphere, where the phenomenon of intellectual immiseration takes on a new significance (Joseph 2003, 131). The market has engulfed the realm of culture and has turned it into an industry. The culture industry makes no pretence to be dealing in high art and openly admits to be selling cultural commodities intended for mass consumption—movies, radio and TV shows—which obey the same principles of market exchange like other commodities, namely product standardisation and substitutability. Films in a given genre have identical plots, actors look similar, and the morale of the stories is predictable. Even in one’s free time, the individual is no longer free: ‘Amusement under late capitalism is the prolongation of work’ (Adorno and Horkheimer 1997 [1944], 137). Leisure has become a non-free activity – it is controlled by the culture industry via the projection of false positivity (the hero defeats the villain), conformism, and above all, by the need to promote further consumption. Criticism of what is given must be avoided at all cost lest that it upsets the pre-established expectations of the mass consumer.The culture industry brings in its trail the abdication of human autonomy and freedom. Because society forms a totality, there is no safe haven inside it for launching a critique of the prevailing order— critics are forced to work with the materials supplied by the integrated social system and the ubiquitous culture industry. If anything, few among the better educated and fortunate would have the luxury of reflection and independent thought; but these few would be individuals, perhaps intellectuals, not entire classes or groups. In this context, the intellectual’s task is to pursue analysis that is philosophical and negative—this is the ethos of Adorno’s negative dialectic. Negative dialectic seeks transcendence by rejecting the false immanence of that which is immediately given to consciousness (Adorno’s non-identity principle, Adorno 1977, 4-5). Because it seeks transcendence, its purposes are metaphysical, and because it seeks to overcome what is merely given as ‘false’, its purposes are critical.Such critical metaphysics works to expose the prevailing order of reified social institutions as false by showing that, even though they pretend to be eternal and unchanging, in reality they are historically transient forms. What is transcendent, therefore, is the act of criticism itself, which for Adorno must involve reflexivity.If negative dialectics calls for the self-reflection of thinking, the tangible implication is that if thinking is to be true –if it is to be true today, in any case – it must also be thinking against itself (Adorno 1973, 365).Adorno’s analysis is pessimistic and the late modernity he portrays, regressive. Relevant here is Adorno and Horkheimer’s dictum that ‘Myth is already enlightenment and enlightenment reverts to mythology’ (1977 [1944], xvi).It may be elucidated as follows (see Adorno and Horkheimer 1977 [1944], 10-29; Wiggershaus 1995, 328-336). The proposition ‘myth is already Enlightenment’ suggests that the first break-up with the stage of mythology, where myth embodies awe at the magical powers of nature, occurs with the arrival of thought (when thought and reflection displace emotion and mimesis as practised by the shaman). But when thought mutates into instrumental reason, as Max Weber predicted, it brings about the disenchantment of the world and the loss of the magical in nature. In the twentieth century, nature (including human nature) has been reduced to an object of domination controlled by scientific and technological means. In the perfectly administered world of today, science and instrumental reason have been turned into Gods that keep us in awe. This is the meaning of the second proposition ‘Enlightenment reverts to mythology’.Adorno, late modernity, and globalisationHow does Adorno’s pessimistic account of late modernity speak to our present condition at the turn of the twenty-first century and in relation to global society? Even though Adorno did not draw such an analogy, his concept of late modernity has affinities with the notion of globalisation. For Anthony Giddens, modernity, understood as the ‘stretching’ of relations in time and space, has become globalised because ‘worldwide social relations’ have been intensified (Giddens 1990, 64). Following Immanuel Wallerstein, Giddens associates globalisation with a ‘world capitalist economy’ (Giddens 1990, 68), but as we have seen, Adorno (like other Frankfurt School members) did not think of late modernity in terms of processes restricted to the economy. For Adorno it is not the case that the economic system determines, as it were, what happens in the political system, be it nationally or globally. Rather, late modernity is a complex, contradictory—or dialectical—development inside which a monopoly-type capitalist economy has been coupled with powerful administrative apparatuses, which may be local or global, and whose capacity for steering is not restricted to the political sphere alone (voting, basic laws). The administered world of late modernity is insidious precisely because it serves to integrate society as a whole, including its cultural sphere which hitherto has been, but no longer seem to be, a site of resistance andfurther alerts us to the threat that Fascism might reappear in novel historical forms. Fascism represents a social system marked by irrationality, scientism, theories of racial superiority, xenophobia, and narratives of national greatness. Former U.S. Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright attributes neo-fascist traits to political leaders such as Donald Trump (US), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Recep Erdogan (Turkey), Viktor Orban (Hungary), Hugo Chavez (Venezuela), and Kim Jong-un (North Korea) (Albright 2008). But we must be weary of passing verdicts centered on any particular nation or state leader since, if Adorno is right, all contemporary societies in late modernity contain fascist elements in one form or another. Adorno believes that the social critic must avoid complacency: critique must remain negative and be subject to further critique.Last but not least, Adorno had an interest in the practice of university teaching (Adorno 2012), and hence the question should be posed whether academic freedom is still possible inside our administered world. Nowadays, and the trend is global, universities have become colonised by powerful administrators who pursue interests of their own—to wit, the further consolidation of administrative power—at variance with the interests of the teachers and students, and without being bound by ethical standards or direct accountability. The remuneration gap between top administrators and those who actually conduct the research and teaching is staggering. Lecturers are routinely appointed on short-term contracts and treated as expendable human resources, whose abundance is secured by the ever-increasing supply of fresh PhDs. Academics are pitted in a competition against each other for the only goods which have exchange value on the academic market—research grants and publications. The assessment of their achievements is based on leadership rather than scholarship, on quantitative Google indexes, on ‘societal impact’ as well as links with the media and industry. It seems that, with regard to homo academicus, Adorno’s critique of late modernity, his pessimism, and his belief that despite everything we should not give up on seeking avenues for recovering freedom, are more apposite than ever."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/16/where-is-god-in-the-anthropocene/,Where is God in the Anthropocene?,Maximilian Lakitsch,Jul 16 2021,"The presence of religious symbols such as the cross or the headscarf in public spaces, the question of the religious or secular nature of a state’s constitution, or religiously motivated violence by Christian, Buddhist or Islamist militias – contrary to the predictions and aspirations of the tradition of enlightenment, religion did not lose any of its relevance in the 21st century in numerous regions from North and South America to Europe, Africa, to the Middle East or Asia. (Bayat 1996; Roy 2001; Woodhead 2016; Svensson and Nilsson 2018; Lakitsch 2021) At the same time, we find ourselves in the geological era of the Anthropocene and its complex materialist ontology, where the dissolution of human sovereignty within a complex web of human and non-human relations seems to contradict the existence of absolute truths and therefore religion and spirituality. (Ferrando 2020: 1-2) Second and maybe more important, this post-anthropocentric turn into a posthuman world is at the same time a turn towards a materialist world. There, the ideas of ideality and transcendence seem to be difficult to uphold. (Jones 2016) If we want to maintain both accounts about religion and the Anthropocene, the idea of god or other divine entities should at least correspond with some kind of material foundation.The depiction of earth’s current era as Anthropocene is based on the acknowledgement of humankind as a geological force. Accordingly, humans at some point in history have gained the ability to indelibly alter the materiality of earth and affect fundamental physical processes. That did not only happen through deforestation, urbanization, overfishing and human-caused mass extinction of life, but most extensively through the enormous rise in carbon dioxide emissions. (Crutzen & Stoermer 2000) As a consequence, rather than affirming humanity’s claim as a sovereign actor, these alterations threaten its survival and therefore unveil that nature has never been an empty stage for any species to act at will. Instead, humans have always been entwined within an infinitely complex web of human and non-human materialities. As a result, contrary to the convictions of humanism and the tradition of enlightenment, humankind is not sovereign in its thinking and doing and shares agency with the non-human world. (Chakrabarty 2009; Stengers 2015; Haraway 2016; Braidotti 2013)So, how does the idea of a divine entity make sense within the relational material ontology of the Anthropocene – whether we understand this divine entity personal or impersonal and abstract? Can we describe a materialist foundation for the belief in an entity with powers and characteristics that transcend and exceed the capabilities of the human and non-human world and have thus been dubbed supernatural and omnipotent? In other words, are there ways to depict a divine entity not as super-material but as inner-material?In some ways, the idea of a divine entity and a posthuman ontology do indeed converge. If we have never been modern (Latour 1993), then we have never been human and secular either. (Graham 2016) After all, various forms of belief in divine entities obviously never fell victim to the process of secularization and even gained influence in social and political life beyond their traditional institutions – we live in a post-secular world. (Habermas, 2008; Taylor 2007) Accordingly, post-secularism does not declare the revival or triumphalism of religion, but emphasizes its permanence which had only been hidden underneath the veil of secularity and modernity. (Serres 1995: 36) As an excluded other, the divine strikes back against the supposedly secular state and its public sphere – it keeps unveiling its presence over and over again (Braidotti 2013: 37) and seriously questions the fixed categories of the secular and the religious. (Asad 2003) In essence, the rise of the religious amongst further non-human others to the stage of history contributes to exposing the cracks and fissure on the once shiny and glittering surface of modernity. (Graham 2016: 58)A divine entity as an underlying foundation of all existing matter introduces an all-encompassing signification which is genuinely post-dualistic and posthuman. As such, the posthuman and the divine date back to the beginning of civilizations and have been more relevant in world regions beyond the epicenters of modernity. Relating to an all-encompassing and unifying entity, the divine binds all that exists and therefore corresponds with a posthuman ontology and its infinitely complex web of human and non-human entities. (Ferrandothe accommodation of religion with the Anthropocene raises questions about the ontological status of a divine entity. Does the divine have to be a human projection like in Feuerbach’s very influential materialist critique of faith? After all, excluding the divine dimension from the realm of the existing does contradict religious experiences and their significance. (Jones 2016) Rudolph Otto (2014) described the significance of someone’s experience of the holy as indication for its existence; not only for its experienced, but for its actual existence. In the end, the significance of religion in our era of the Anthropocene seems to justify at least an attempt to describe a material foundation for god or any other divine entity.In order to do so, the divine entity shall not be regarded as something idealistic beyond this world. Rather, it shall be understood as something within this world, which is independent from humankind and its imagination. Materiality as such genuinely relates to a certain understanding of transcendence: It transcends everyone’s context and encompasses all human and non-human matter. This understanding of transcendence resonates with a depiction of the absolute as absolved (ab-solutus) from a certain context. (Bennett 2010: 1-3) That corresponds with Spinoza’s monistic ontological conception of god as all material substance: deus sive natura sive substantia. (Spinoza, Eth. IV Praef) Matter is all that is and therefore the foundation of everything – that which everything stands on (sub-stantia). (Spinoza, Eth. IP1-15) Accordingly, transcendence refers to the continuity of the world beyond oneself – like the beauty of the world as something that is experienced within a certain context but that to refers to the whole material world or universe. (Calhoun 2012) Transcendence builds on the transcending character of the particular material context towards an all-encompassing materiality.Another possibility to understand transcendence in a materialist ontology lies in the poietic aspect of matter. In this regard, the focus is not on the real and the actually existing materiality, but on the becoming. (Calhoun 2012: 355) Transcendence relates to materiality that transcends the existing towards the becoming and thereby towards unrealized possibilities. (Graham 2016) It is thus located in between the various materialities – as a sympoietic inter-materiality that “redistributes [materiality’s] qualities and powers among a plurality of self-creative earth subjects [and] suggests a divine-world relationship characterized by co-creativity and radical mutuality.” (Roberts 2018) An inter-material understanding of transcendence with an emphasis on the poietic aspect corresponds with Martin Riesebrodt’s definition of religious powers as having the ability to influence what is beyond human control, whether that concerns the natural or the social life. (Riesebrodt 2010: 2-20; 71-75)Most certainly, those elaborations like any other theoretical attempt to make sense of the divine can only grasp the “god of the philosophers” and not the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Jesus, as Blaise Pascal (1966: 309-310) put it. The divine experience of an inner fire – “[c]ertainty, certainty, heartfelt, joy, peace” (Ibid.) – necessarily remains beyond the reach of the word. Nevertheless, elaborations on materialist interpretations of transcendence and the absolute indicate ways towards possible understandings god and the divine within a complex ontology of the Anthropocene. They pave the way to not only elaborate on an ontological counter-part for the vitality of religion, but also to describe it in its irreducibility exceeding human capabilities to grasp it. That allows for a divine astonishment to remain with the “irreducibly strange dimension of matter” (Bennett 2010: 1-3) and thereby to echo Otto’s mysterium tremendum et fascinans. (Otto 2014: 13-37)"
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/16/by-our-own-hands-and-by-theirs-africans-and-the-nervousness-to-belong/,By Our Own Hands and by Theirs: Africans and the Nervousness to Belong,Benjamin Maiangwa and Christiane Essombe,Jul 16 2021,"The history of colonization, including forms of endogenous wars of conquests such as the 19th century Mfecane in southern Africa or the Islamic jihad led by Uthman dan Fodio in northern Nigeria forced people of those regions to renegotiate their identity to survive and created, within them a nervousness of being accepted and belonging. As one’s own identity is ostracized, it can become common to interiorize this violence and redirect it against other Africans who are now the stereotyped out-group. Such lateral violence has birthed an intractable identity crisis that has erupted in unimaginable violence to self, other, and society.“Where are you from?” is a common question posed by Africans to their fellow citizens. As innocent as this question appears, it is, of course, a product of colonization, achieved through the forceful and expedient border arrangements forged by the colonizers for their own prosperity. The same arrangement has continued to function as it was conceived in the beginning. Africans, rather than reclaiming their own references to identify each other as members of a people, without obfuscating their uniqueness, rely on imposed names and borders that effectively divided ethno-cultural groups, resulting in present-day conflicts. Franz Fanon blames this burdensome inheritance in the postcolony on the pitfalls of national consciousness. He argues thus:National consciousness, instead of being the all-embracing crystallization of the innermost hopes of the whole people…will be in any case only an empty shell, a crude and fragile travesty of what it might have been.The proliferation of platforms for self-determination or secessionist campaigns in the postcolony is not unrelated to the physical and structural violence associated with this travesty of national consciousness. If “being oppressed means the absence of choices” as bell hooks argues, then it can be said that oppressed Africans have constructed, since colonization, psychological and physical barriers hinged on a normalized hatred, underappreciation and dismissal of their own capacities and worth. These physical borders have coalesced with the psychological to wreak devastating havoc on socio-political relations in the continent.In South Africa, as with Nigeria, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, South Sudan, and so on, the nervousness of belonging has percolated national and everyday politics in the form of xenophobic attacks and affirmative action that alienate the relatively vulnerable “foreigner”- usually one that is not White. Indeed, Black African foreigners bearing the brunt of xenophobic attacks highlights deep-rooted Afrophobia. Rather than questioning the root of that phenomenon, lateral violence has instead become the go-to answer: attacking those who have been historically marginalized and dehumanized to position one-self as superior and “different” from the alleged “job-stealer, disease-spreader African”.Whether we label those reactions as nonsensical, puzzling or concerning, they all point to the absence of a shared African identity. Sadly it appears that questioning the legacy of anti-African bias, inter-African violence and the very social hierarchy that rewards those closer to former colonists and overlooks “natives”, is a road too seldom travelled and less attractive than resorting to senseless violence.Xenophobia, in all its ramifications, mirrors the tragedy of the crisis of belonging. It shows the barbarity that comes when Africans are more concerned with appearing “less Africans” than others. Thus, it can only be described as the dehumanization of Africans by Africans, a self-eradication that can’t possibly be beneficial. Once again, Africans have effectively become theis further evidenced as the structures of the so-called postcolonial state are geared toward the extirpation of the “other”, instead of challenging othering in the first place, particularly in societies that have historically been divided and engineered on the very premise of othering. Acts of cruelty that accompany the treatments of so-called “strangers”, “foreigners”, or “visitors” in many African societies have all the lineaments of the twentieth-century wars, where those castigated as outsiders were treated as “members of an inferior and indeed malignant species”. Structures of difference in Africa have been created to maintain a hierarchy in which those in powerful positions continue to access the best schools, degree programs, and basic resources, while undermining the legitimate rights and existence of others. This situation lends weight to what Ali Mazrui calls the conflict of “who is who”. The conflict represents the “tribalized” fractious nature of the postcolonial state, which still bears the bitter fruits of its colonial past.With biological social markers such as skin colour or ethnic identity that result in ostracization wherever one is, racial trauma will manifest itself even in mundane health indicators.Furthermore, when history books, laws and the media depict Black people as inferior, dangerous, invisible or when kids’ books prefer depicting non-human characters insteadof a “Black” one, 1 of 2 things can happen: learning to despise oneself or actively desiring to fit into the dominant social group. Both alternatives crystallize the nervousness of wanting to belong and never being accepted.Africans or those for whom the “black” insignia has been appended on their identity in the diaspora are not spared this nervousness of belonging. Whoopi Goldberg exclaims after Barack Obama became President in 2008 that: “I always thought of myself as an American, with all of the promise that America holds. But suddenly last night I felt like I could put my suitcase down…finally.” Many African Americans heralded Obama’s administration as the closure they needed to finally call the United States home and live the American dream. Yet, since the euphoria that greeted Obama’s emergence as the first “black” President fizzled out, they were once again reminded of the premise of this country. The tiniest glimpse of light was immediately followed by the Presidency of the “first White president” and an increase of white supremacist terrorists attacks in the US. These are not coincidences; these are calls to arms to reclaim what is seen as a de facto White country.The case of Christian Cooper, the “Black” birder in Central Park, and Amy Cooper, the “White” lady with the leashed dog, springs to mind. It is an all too familiar case for many a Black person whose only crime is to exist in white spaces. Amy Cooper is only a symbol of whiteness: a system of power that is bent on tasking White people to distribute and deny non-White individuals their right as they see fit by discrediting their character, intentions, or personhood.On that infamous day, Amy Cooper firmly set herself to benefit from this system of power that designates and criminalizes “black” people for being “black”. She explicitly communicated her intention to display the power of her whiteness by punishing a “Black” man who dared to question her. History has repeatedly shown that “White” women can weaponize black skin – specifically that of Black men- without fearing any repercussions. Thus she told the police a grotesque lie that she and her dog were being threatened by “a man, African-American.” Christian Cooper knew that his “blackness” alone discredited him to question the actions of a “white woman” in a “white space” which is likely why he anticipated that a recording would come inexample illustrates that to be black is to live with and anticipate the “specter of violence” that can unleash only because of one’s black skin. It is to be judged guilty because of your skin, figuratively and legally. It is a life-long questioning about one’s true identity outside of the relentlessness and insidiousness of racism. It is to live in a “nervous condition”.In a conversation with a Caribbean woman, the first author was introduced into the nervousness of her belonging.Ben: Where would you say you belong?Woman: My homeland. But I am afraid to go there due to the violence and a lack of a sense of self. We have lost our ties to our ancestry and have no connection to an Indigenous language. That part of us is gone. But you are visible when you have a lighter skin. When I look at Africans, the way they move, speak about their origin with a sense of pride, I feel impressed and would like to visit. But I am also afraid.Ben: You think Africans in Africa are in a much better place?Woman: Yes, the way you have your language. That is yours. You created it. The beauty of the women: The strong beautiful Zulu woman or the graciousness of the Maasai. The cultural antiques, attires, and so on. There are pieces of my culture I can never teach my children. I am not romanticizing Africa. But here in Canada, I speak English, but I am forever being corrected because of the shade of my skin. My English is the same as the white person, but my colour tells the onlooker that English is not mine. As descendants of slaves, we long for the journey home but we fear it. I crave the feel of what Swahili sounds. I like the clicking of the Zulu language. But I have none of that. I don’t have the language to express myself. So, I am forever an outsider. It’s hard. When African people talk about their ancestry, I talk about slavery.This discussion went on and became painful as both participants dived deeper. It was especially painful when the woman spoke about Africa as a place that knows itself and glorifies its people. It was painful because this reality is slipping away. The African identity slips away when we, Africans, only know how to look at what is ours from a colonial vantage point.Jean Paul Sartre used the notion of nervous condition in the preface of the Wretched of the Earth to evoke “the “disassociated self” created by colonialism. This nervousness has outlived the Europeans on the continent. Africans have become obsessed not with the often diasporic burden of “blackness” (although colorism is present), but with the notions of individual power – whether social or economic –and “tribe”. We have used these “tribal” identities to reproduce the same specter of violence and discrimination as a way of protecting “native custom”.While “tribal” identities may seem permanent, Mahmood Mamdani argues that they should be treated as malleable historical constructs, which could be denaturalized in social and political relations. To do this, he insists we must think beyond the concept of a nation-state that categorizes people into permanent minorities, settlers, or immigrants. He says we must begin to realize how we are all wounded or colonized by the system and regard ourselves more as survivors with a new opportunity to find a unifying agenda and sense of purpose that would assuage the anxieties and fears we so deeply feel about each other.We are hardwired to belong to something, to a place we can call home. A belonging, as Douglas Alexander argues, that is far more “primal than our politics today suggests”. We must move beyond partisanship and forge a truly inclusive place on our own terms where Africans can finally belong, exist without being erased and feel at home, alongside other oppressed people also seeking to reclaim their"
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/15/ngoization-from-activism-to-advocacy/,‘NGOization’: From Activism to Advocacy,Paula Lobato Gonzalez,Jul 15 2021,"Since the 1990s, the perception and work of NGOs has begun to shift. Driven both by external and internal pressures, these organizations have increasingly been plunged into a process of ‘NGOization’. NGOization is a trend in the structural construction of NGOs that produces a shift from horizontal and broad organizations to more vertical and professionalized roles (Lang 2012, p. 73). NGOs have moved from “engaging with” to “talking about” social and political concerns (Lang 2012, p. 91). This trend is found both in democratic societies as well as in areas undergoing processes of democratic development, although with different intensity depending on the historical context of each society (Mojab 2009, p. 105-110), and is often motivated by large funding from international organizations (Lang 2012, p. 73). The aim of this article is to look at the concept of NGOization, how it has been constructed, what the trend implies for NGOs, as well as its main consequences and criticisms. Lastly, it will explore the process of NGOization in the particular case of women’s organizations in Turkey.It is necessary to clarify that NGOs and civil society are not interchangeable concepts, even though they are sometimes difficult to separate. As Feldman points out, in many cases civil society might have interests or demands that are not to be found in NGOs. Additionally, there may be relations of contradictory directions, with civil society working through more bottom-up relations and NGOs often engaging in top-down ones. Lastly, the relationship between NGOs and the State is increasingly intense and solid. Promoted by the current neoliberal system, NGOs are beginning to become part of this power structure. Such rapprochement and links lead to a closer alignment of NGOs’ demands and work with institutional power. In short, NGOs become political actors embedded in the established system (Feldman 1997, p.62-64).Different authors have proposed different frameworks for analyzing the main variables influencing the trend of NGOization, although they all share some common variables. For Choudhry and Kapoor (2013, p. 5), the most influential factors are professionalization, institutionalization, depoliticization and demobilization, while for Lang (2012, p. 75), the key change variables are professionalization, institutionalization and bureaucratization. Based on the ideas extracted from the authors, and after reviewing selected literature on the subject, this article will examine some of these variables and shared trends, with a focus on institutionalization and professionalization, as these are the ones that the literature has considered to be the most relevant. This article will also examine some relevant trends, namely the shift from activism to advocacy, the still perceived altruism and the emerging elitism (Lang 2012, Ungsuchaval 2016, Morris & Goldsworthy 2008, Skrentny 2003).As underlined by the above-mentioned authors, there is a substantial focus on the processes of professionalization and institutionalization of NGOs. The first of these processes is highly related to the adaptation of the members and of the NGO itself to the language of public policy; a trend that is occurring with increasing intensity and speed. In order to see its evolution, it is useful to observe the tax declarations and employee structures in these organisations. With regards to the process of institutionalization, it can occur in three directions: through its organizational structure, through the policy opportunities offered, such as consultancy, and through increased porosity among members who migrate from working in NGOs to working in formal political institutions (Lang 2012, p. 73). Overall, the trend of NGOization produces a closer proximity between NGOs and the State, with NGOs ceasing to be external subjects and becoming actors in the official decision-making process (Ungsuchaval 2016, p. 29).In addition to these main variables, NGOization leads to observable structural change processes in the organization. Some of these important novelties are: increased individualization of power and authority, creation of structured legislative frameworks, increased control over cooperation, growth in instrumentalization of relationships, adoption of a more competitive perspective in staff recruitment, creation of salaries, hierarchical structure and division of labour (Lang 2012, p. 67). The NGO begins to focus on specific results and funds, rather than on ethics or shared values, becoming more technocratic in its ethos. In order to survive and achieve positive political influence and access to funds, NGOs become “colonised by governmental ways of doing business” (Harwood & Creighton 2009, p.to the main trends, one of the main consequences of the NGOization process is the shift from activism to advocacy. The main differences between these two trends are based on a more result-oriented and less multidisciplinary activity, as well as a shift in the shape of mobilization, with greater collaboration with authorities (Paternotte 2016, p. 3). Another effect of NGOization is the “perceived altruism” that continues to be associated with NGOs. Historically, NGOs have been perceived as highly moral and altruistic, but, with the process of NGOization, there is a turning point from “commitment to a particular issue” to instead merely “talking about that particular issue” (Morris & Goldsworthy 2008, p. 125-126). Finally, the elitism that comes with the process of NGOization has been widely criticized, as it leads to greater professionalization and institutionalization for the survival of the NGO. Indemocratically developing countries, “civic oligarchies” are created (Henderson 2003, p. 9), leading to a detachment from the beneficiaries and the social base of the movement (Ungsuchaval, 2016, p. 4). The resulting elitism creates greater difficulties for the beneficiaries and the social base to actively participate and raise their demands, as the networks or oligarchies established tend to be more and more private and exclusive.Therefore, the process of NGOization has a number of major implications for the work of NGOs. The existence of institutional actors that support social change from within is fundamental for it to take place (Skrentny 2003, p. 269). However, and as we have seen, the consequences of entering the institutional sphere affect the structure of the organisation, its internal formation and perspectives of external action, more focused on particular results and funds. This ends up negatively affecting the social base and the qualitative impact of the work (Ungsuchaval 2016, p. 10), while increasing the complexity and elitism of participation and demands.In order to look at the process of NGOization and ground the analysis, the particular case of women’s organisations in Turkey and the main criticisms they are facing will be examined. In Turkey, the decade of the 1990s saw a rapid growth in the number of women’s organisations and a high institutionalization of the feminist movement. This process of NGOization of Turkish feminism through project-based feminism has led to the emergence of a number of internal criticisms (Keysan 2019, p. 54-58). Turkish NGOs are receiving extensive support from the EU, among others, by granting them large financial support and encouraging the execution of a number of projects. Similarly, these organisations enjoyed great support from the government during the AKP’s first decade in power (2002-2012), a period during which the government became increasingly active and supportive of a large number of organizations and civil society participation (Keysan 2019, p. 85).Project-based feminism has led to an increase in the number of women participants and broadened the target groups. However, there has been a shift from active militancy to advocacy, causing the political elements and character of feminism to be diluted among the projects. Similarly, many organisations are primarily driven by issues of economic profit, missing the fundamental point of the fight for women’s rights (Diner & Toktaş 2010, p. 54-55). Finally, the high educational and cultural level required to write these projects causes a division between an elite that presents and manages projects, and a grassroots that participates in them (Coşar & Onbaşi 2008, p. 340). In the Turkish context, this is particularly the case in projects for Kurdish women, where the feminist militancy of this group has a wide background (Diner & Toktaş 2010, p. 56).In conclusion, the NGOization trend, now occurring on a global scale, even if with different degrees depending on the country and the type of organisation, has reshaped the paradigm of social action and its translation into political changes. Professionalization, institutionalization, bureaucratization, depoliticization and demobilization have led to structural changes in the way social demands are perceived and elaborated, leading to a shift from activism to advocacy in the way in which mobilizations are developed and responses are given to society’s concerns. All in all, it is crucial to observe and analyze this process, because NGOs have a fundamental role to play in making society’s demands be heard. Therefore, we need to reassess their work in order to prevent their increasing links with the existing political establishment, so that they can continue to be a vehicle for social demands and realAnheier, HK & Toepler, S. 2009.‘International encyclopedia of civil society’ Springer Science & Business Media.Choudry, A & Kapoor, D.2013. ‘Introduction: NGOization: Complicity, Contradictions and Prospects’.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/15/opinion-the-icc-and-non-state-actors-in-the-xinjiang-crisis/,Opinion – The ICC and Non-State Actors in the Xinjiang Crisis,Wilder Alejandro Sanchez,Jul 15 2021,"As the humanitarian crisis continues in Xinjiang, the East Turkestan government-in-exile (ETGE) has delivered new evidence to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to demonstrate said international judicial body’s jurisdiction. Without a doubt, the international community, particularly global and regional powers, has a critical role to play in stopping the egregious human rights abuses that have occurred for several years against various ethnic groups in this region, including atrocities committed against the Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and ethnic Kyrgyz. However, in light of the inaction by many key governments, the East Turkestan government-in-exile and activists are turning to non-state actors, like the ICC and private corporations, to pressure Beijing to end its repressive policies.As Gani Stambekov, president of Free Kazakhs, explains, “the longer we procrastinate the more chance [the] Chinese regime will have time and opportunity to cover up its crimes.” The ETGE first filed a complaint to the ICC on 6 July, 2020, accusing Chinese authorities of rounding up and forcefully deporting Uyghurs from Tajikistan, a State Party to the Rome Statute, into a “China Occupied East Turkistan.”However, in a December 2020 report, the ICC ruled that the case would not move forward, since, “in the present situation, from the information available, it does not appear that the Chinese officials involved in these forcible repatriation fulfilled the required elements [as] described.” The report added that,while the conduct of such officials may have served as a precursor to the subsequent alleged commission of crimes on the territory of China, over which the Court lacks jurisdiction, the conduct occurring on the territory of States Parties does not appear, on the information available, to fulfil material elements of the crime of deportation under article 7(1)(d) of the Statute.The ETGE remains committed to its case, and it has submitted new evidence to demonstrate that not only are human rights abuses occurring in Xinjiang, but also in neighboring Tajikistan. As The Economist explains, “there is no evidence of mass killings of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, but there are credible reports of extra judicial detentions, torture, sterilisations, forced labour and many other horrors that could constitute crimes against humanity.” Evidence of how “Chinese authorities are rounding up and forcefully deporting Uyghurs from Tajikistan,” was reportedly submitted. “There is also evidence of a newly constructed triple barbed wire Chinese border fence well within Tajik territory,” according to the ETGE.Another strategy that activists and supporters of the Uyghur population are carrying out is a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, scheduled to take place in Beijing. So far, this idea has not gained much traction. The International Olympics Committee argues that it must remain “neutral” and not become involved in politics. Similarly there is pressure on major companies, like Gap, H&M, and Adidas, to sever ties with China as it has been revealed that many of their garments are made with Uyghur forced labor. Technology companies like Apple, Amazon and Tesla have also been accused of theChinese government is adamant that what is taking place in Xinjiang is not repression and there are no human rights abuses. Foreign Affairs Minister Wang Yi said in February that “such inflammatory accusations are fabricated out of ignorance and prejudice, they are simply malicious and politically driven hype and couldn’t be further from the truth.” In actuality, Beijing argues, the “re-education” camps are only meant for violent individuals and criminals, and they serve to reform them and give them a better place in society.Stambekov argues that international pressure is forcing Beijing to slowly tell the truth about the situation in Xinjiang. “China first denied the existence of the camps, saying that they were false allegations, but later it agreed to the existence of the facilities but called them ‘re-education camps.’” He also warned about Beijing adapting its repressive tactics; for example when the international community revealed the coordinates of concentration camps, Chinese authorities demolished some of them and transferred prisoners to underground facilities. “An ethnic Kazakh named Tursynbek, who was a concentration camp victim and survivor, explained to us that when Chinese officers came for him in his cell, they put a black bag over his head and took him to an underground prison,” he remarked.Unfortunately, and unsurprisingly, the international community is divided on how to respond to the crisis. At the crux of the problem is the influence of the Chinese government, specifically the country’s economic wealth and the investment opportunities (e.g. the Belt and Road Initiative) that influence both developing and developed nations. Several governments, whether at the executive or legislative level, have passed resolutions, bills, or made announcements condemning the situation, including the United States, Canada, and Belgium. However, many governments have been silent about the crisis. For example, a resolution to condemn the situation was blocked in Australia by the federal government and the Labor Party in April. There have also been accusations that some governments have supported Beijing’s policies by extraditing Uyghurs to China.One noteworthy example of conflicting objectives is the Republic of Kazakhstan. Apart from Uyghurs, tens of thousands of ethnic Kazakhs have also been imprisoned. According to some human rights activists, the number is as high as half a million. Free Kazakhs has a project called “Half a Million Kazakhs” which is the estimated number of ethnic Kazakhs imprisoned in the camps. However Kazakhstan, which borders China, has strong economic relations with Beijing, hence has to act cautiously so that it can help ethnic Kazakhs across the border without angering one of its most prominent trade partners.In recent years there has been a growing anti-Chinese sentiment in Kazakhstan, mostly due to the perception of Chinese influence in the country, including land purchases by Chinese citizens, whether as part of an investment project or in a personal capacity. There are also constant protests in front of the Chinese embassy and consulates in Kazakhstan regarding the human rights crisis;however, these have not become widespread.As there is no global united front regarding the crisis in Xinjiang, we are witnessing the evolution of strategies by East Turkestan government-in-exile, friendly governments, the Uyghur diaspora and their supporters to pressure and bring accountability to Beijing. As many governments remain silent, entities like the ICC and industries have now become focal points of the ETGE and allies. For example, pressuring global giants like Apple or Adidas to ensure that they do not use Uyghur forced labor would affect their overall relationship with Beijing, something that the Chinese government wants to protect in order to maintain economic growth. As for the future of a case against the Chinese government at the ICC, it is too early to tell if the Court will confirm that it has jurisdiction – not to mention the difficulty of doing so since China is not awhile pressuring Beijing is a delicate game of chess with serious geopolitical and economic consequences, hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Kyrgyz continue to suffer in Xinjiang. As more time passes, Beijing will have more opportunities to come up with creative methods use its influence on the international community to stop investigations and deflect accusations.The views presented in this article are the author’s own.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/14/nagorno-karabakh-the-endless-conflict-in-the-black-garden/,Nagorno-Karabakh: The Endless Conflict in the Black Garden,Roland Benedikter,Jul 14 2021,"Following U.S. President Joe Biden’s April 2021 recognition of the mass murder of Armenians in the 20th century as genocide, there is new movement in the Caucasus. Both Turkey and Armenia have been involved in the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the “mountainous black garden” in the South Caucasus. In 2020, the latest war between Azerbaijan and Armenia occurred in a seemingly endless history of conflict. The situation seems intractable to many. The war over the territory has hardened the fronts and plunged Armenia, the losing nation, into chaos. Many questions remain unresolved. Nevertheless, there are (limited) prospects, including the diplomatic initiatives of the OSCE as well as individual states such as Russia. A very special institutional-regulatory model of pacification has been repeatedly brought into play since the 1990s: South Tyrol. Territorial autonomy there has transformed ethnic conflicts into institutionalized coexistence. The question is how realistic it is to adapt this model in the Caucasus.Aspects of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region between Azerbaijan and Armenia are indeed not dissimilar to those of the South Tyrol conflict between Austria and Italy. Already since the second half of the 1990s – especially after the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in 1994, which led to a “frozen” transitional situation until November 2020 – delegations from the 1994 loser nation Azerbaijan have repeatedly visited the Autonomous Province of Bolzano-South Tyrol in the border triangle of Italy-Austria-Switzerland to study the model for possible conflict solutions involving the international community. There is an East-West focus at the Eurac Research Center for Advanced Studies in Bozen-Bolzano. An international Nagorno-Karabakh conference of the Eurac Research Institute for Federalism and Minority Rights took place at the end of October 2020 with the participation of Mario Raffaelli from Trentino province, who acted as mediator of the OSCE Minsk Group between Armenia and Azerbaijan and helped to develop the six “Madrid Principles” for Nagorny-Karabakh conflict resolution in 2007. In addition, there has been the work of the Eurac Institute for Comparative Federalism for the Minsk Group in particular, especially for minorities and displaced persons. The region was a topic at the major Central Asia Conference in Moscow in 2019, where a re-ignition of the conflict was already emerging as a possibility in wordings and a certain populist rhetoric of nationalism.This article presents some thoughts over the following four points in order to provide a minimal basis for discussion on the current situation:What is the conflict about?Causes and backgroundsPossible solutionsPerspectivesWhat is the conflict about?The conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, the “mountainous black garden” in the South Caucasus, has a long and complex history, including the autonomy issue involved. Similar to other “hyper-complex” conflicts, the conflict presents religious, ethnic and civil-religious-nationalist components in addition to political and economic ones, which make it particularly difficult to resolve. Identity narratives play an essential role in the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, which has repeatedly led both the territorial powers and the major powers behind them to engage in symbolic policies that encouraged conflict. For centuries, the coexistence of the closely interlocked Armenian and Azerbaijani populations has produced both positive and negative examples. In addition, the multiple changes in the ethnic-territorial distribution of the population have not made things easier. In modern times, after the Russian November Revolution, Nagorno-Karabakh was annexed to Azerbaijan in 1921-23 despite an Armenian majority (though with a larger Azerbaijani minority at the time than today), partly because the Bolsheviks there had greater influence in Moscow than their Armenian counterparts. Despite repeated attempts by Armenia and the representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh to change the affiliation to Armenia, nothing changed until the collapse of the Soviet Union indecline of the Soviet multi-ethnic state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988 led to a resurgence of nationalism also in the Caucasus and resulted in Nagorno-Karabakh’s renewed application to change from Azerbaijan to the Soviet Republic of Armenia, which was rejected by Moscow. As a result, the region unilaterally declared itself independent in 1991 under the name “Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh”, since 2017 under the name “Republic of Arzakh” (the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh), which was not recognised by any other state, nor by Armenia itself for lack of prospects of success. As a result, a full-scale war developed from 1991 to 1994 with the participation of regular army units from both sides, which claimed up to 30,000 victims and forced about 700,000 Azerbaijanis and 400,000 Armenians to flee the region. It ended with an Armenian victory, the maintenance of Nagorno-Karabakh’s de facto autonomous status and the occupation of surrounding Azerbaijani territories, the so-called seven districts, which Armenia henceforth occupied as “buffer zones” on the grounds of military security. Between 1991 and 2020, a “frozen conflict” emerged from this constellation without a definitive solution. The “freeze” appeared to the background powers and the international community, including Russia, Turkey, Iran and the OSCE, as well as various EU states in the diplomacy-oriented Minsk Group, including France, to be the only way to keep the region in balance and stability, given the complexity and lack of prospects for a definitive consensual solution.However, from 27 September to 10 November 2020, a new six-week regional war unfolded in which the Azerbaijani army, supported by the “brother nation” Turkey, “responded” to alleged Armenian provocations with a large-scale attack. This allegedly involved Arab, including Syrian and Libyan mercenaries mediated by Turkey, as well as state-of-the-art weaponry, including drones and heavy long-range bombardments. Even before that, in 2016 and in between, there were repeated smaller skirmishes with casualties that were barely registered by the international community. The all-too-small OSCE border control mission, with a team of only six, was overwhelmed by the situation. This latest war claimed at least 4000 victims and ended with a clear victory for Azerbaijan. On 10 November 2020, after the failure of EU and OSCE peace missions, a ceasefire was agreed under more or less mono-lateral mediation by Armenia’s protecting power, Russia. The ceasefire provided for the deployment of Russian mediation troops, the territorial return of the seven occupied districts as well as parts of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan, and the restoration of Azerbaijani sovereignty over the territory in principle, although many individual modalities remain to be clarified. Of the approximately 150,000 inhabitants of Nagorno-Karabakh, 99% of whom are Armenians according to reports by the German Federal Agency for Civic Education (Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung), about 90,000 had fled in the course of this war.Causes and backgroundsThe causes and backgrounds of why a new open war broke out in the autumn of 2020 after repeated smouldering small conflicts lie, as always with larger military confrontations, in the coincidence of various factors. Essentially, five dimensions worked together here, which mutually reinforced each other under the given conditions of the time. As always, the historical situation was decisive, since individual reasons usually only interact to produce a war when the surrounding larger historical moment makes it possible or favours it.The five dimensions are as follows:i) De-internationalisation and the trend towards neo-nationalism in the global grand scheme of thingsThe Caucasus has long been seen as a powder keg with many “unsolvable” conflicts that many stakeholders believe must be frozen until the historical moment for a more consensual solution arrives. But this would presuppose a certain recognition of primacy of multilateralism and international law by all sides. The respective readiness has been weakened in recent years; and with it the international and, depending on that, the territorial climate changed. Since the second half of the 2010s, neo-nationalisms have sprung up globally, encouraging more nationalist initiatives, so that there was a growing willingness in the area to suspend balances in order to satisfy national interests. States returned to their own interest policies, including with regard to Nagorno-Karabakh. The politics of spheres of influence also experienced its resurrection by means of the “return of geography” (Paul Dibb), also called the “revenge of geography” (Robert D. Kaplan), as a strategic mentality. Therefore, the recent war of 2020 can be described as a neo-nationalist war, especially between the two states involved, Azerbaijan and Armenia, but also of the interested powers behind them, Russia (Armenia) and Turkey (Azerbaijan) respectively. Iran, as a regional power with a direct common border with Nargorno-Karabakh, was indirectly involved as a third party, but has up to a third of Azerbaijanis in its population and therefore does not want to be drawn into a new AzerbaijaniA proxy war of new great power ambitions between Russia and TurkeyThe Nagorno-Karabakh war of 2020 was also a “proxy war”. New regional great power ambitions of neighbouring powers became effective – not least as a consequence of the return of geography. The neo-nationalist wave encouraged a new “chess game” mentality and resulting strategic manoeuvres in the zone. A paradoxical logic prevailed: both proxy war powers, Russia and Turkey (Putin-Erdogan), were able to profit from the conflict. For by means of the recent Nagorno-Karabakh conflict of 2020, both powers have in fact helped each other to strengthen their presence in the Caucasus and to “dialectically” expand their territorial power in the style of the 19th century. De facto, they have divided the overall zone between them. On the one hand, Azerbaijan has become more dependent on Turkey; on the other hand, Russia, in addition to its already existing military base, has become even more entrenched in the area by providing the pacification troops, and Armenia has become even more dependent on its protecting power. However, there is a danger that when this process of mutual strengthening of both background powers is completed, it may eventually lead to conflicts between Russia and Turkey – which at the same time are partners or at least partly strategically cooperate in other conflict contexts such as Syria. This could make the overall cooperation between the regional powers even more complex.iii) Domestic political reasonsRearmament, provided by Russia to both Armenia and Azerbaijan after 1994 on a rather strict business-basis, was paired with an increasing civil-religious charge of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute on both sides. Identity-revanchism became stronger with the global rise of “imaginal politics” and the return of “tribal politics”. In addition and following another global trend, a certain populism emerged on both sides, which “naturally” played with the ethnic component in the disputed area. Nationalist populisms on both sides used symbolic strategies, albeit to different degrees and not in the same way. One domestic nationalist point of contention was the Yerevan-Stepanakert highway, which was an instrument for the “integration” of Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia and was also understood as such by both sides (similar to the Tirana-Prishtina highway between Albania and Kosovo in the Balkans).iv) Religious fault linesArmenia is not only Christian, but even sees itself as an “Original Christian” nation; Azerbaijan is Islamic with a Shia majority. Both sides were forcedly secularised in Soviet and post-Soviet times, and those in charge tried to tone down the religious component. But since the “return of religion” in the 1990s, it has been reinforced again. This included the role of Christian activism of the Armenian diaspora in France, but also of Islam, likewise in France, a nation that in recent years has been repeatedly shaken by religion-based terror and religious conflicts. This had repercussions which echoed in the conflict area. The fact that France sits on the OSCE Minsk Council is a footnote that seems not entirely unimportant here.v) EconomyTwo pipelines run close to the disputed area. The issue of resource control should not be underestimated, as it is perceived to be of particular importance for nations dependent on it, especially in times of pending transformation of the energy issue.Understandably, many questions arise about the outcome of the recent conflict. Why did Azerbaijan win the 2020 war when it lost the 1994 one? Because it is now economically and, as a consequence, militarily far stronger than it was in 1994, mainly because of its wealth provided by mineral resources, especially oil and gas – and because it was actively supported by Turkey. In contrast, on the Armenian side, Russia tended to act more cautiously because of its previous Ukraine and Crimea policies. The generally more expansive attitude of the authoritarian Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, especially since his “comprehensive” assumption of power in 2014 and after the failed coup of July 2016, also played an important role in the re-escalation to open conflict. Erdogan dreams of an Islamic superpower between East and West and sees the “brother nation” Azerbaijan as his natural sphere of influence similarly to the Chinese province of Xinjiang (Uyghurs). He is pursuing great power politics from the Caucasus to Syria and Libya. That is why some thought that this war was ironically the end of an independent Azerbaijan, because the country had strategically become part of the Turkish influence sphere. As is always the case in conflicts, the behaviour of Turkey is also due to the desire for revenge on the part of those who consider themselves underestimated or not taken seriously – in other words, it is also due to political psychology. Above all, Erdogan wants to show the EU that he hassummarize, the Executive Director of the World Trends Institute for International Politics Potsdam, Erhard Crome, in a dialogue with the author put the situation in these words:The actions of Russia and Turkey in the region are usually portrayed as competition. The quintessence of their actions in the Caucasus and the Middle East is that they are both expanding their positions, not together, but in a pseudo-competition that basically amounts to reciprocity. In the process, they are pushing the West, the EU and the U.S. alike, out of the conflicts and their resolution, and geopolitically out of the region. Turkey has increased its control over Azerbaijan. Putin never wanted bad relations with Aliyev. In Armenia, Pashinyan had blinked toward the West during his ‘velvet revolution.’ In this respect, his and Armenia’s defeat in 2020 came just at the right time: Russia now has a stronger, treaty-based presence in the region with peacekeeping troops, and a new Maidan became a distant prospect. Thanks to Putin, Armenia did not lose all of Karabakh, and Erdogan ensured that Azerbaijan did not win all of it. The Western blink is just answered by Biden with the recognition of the genocide of Armenians in the First World War. But this seems to me a rather helpless symbolic gesture. Incidentally, all the analysts are skirting an interesting geopolitical issue: by letting the currently unemployed IS fighters go to Libya, Chad or the Caucasus to die as religious fighters, Erdogan is reducing their numbers in Idlib. That means Russia and Assad won’t have to do much bombing there before the area is one day returned to the government in Damascus, whoever is president there then.Possible solutionsThree main building blocks can be considered for solutions and perspectives – although all three remain ambiguous in terms of strategic manageability and concrete implementation on the ground: a) the latest ceasefire agreement of 10 November 2020; b) the Madrid Principles of 2007; c) the South Tyrol model.a) The ceasefire agreement of 10 November 2020 called for, among other things,the cessation of hostilities, the return to Azerbaijan of all districts in the vicinity of Nagorno-Karabakh previously controlled by Armenian forces, the deployment of Russian peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the return of refugees under the supervision of the UN Refugee Agency.b) The Madrid Principles were presented by the OSCE in 2007 and reaffirmed by the Minsk diplomatic group in 2009. They were not intended as a solution, but as a mechanism for détente and at the same time a freeze, which – in a sometimes deliberately imprecise manner – was to initiate a path towards the preparation of a longer-lasting solution. As Uwe Halbach (Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik Berlin) summarised it:Since 1992, the Minsk Group of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has been mediating in the conflict, of which Germany is a member. Since 1997, it has been led by three co-chairs: USA, Russia and France… Since 2007, the ‘6 Madrid Principles’ have been on the negotiating table. They provide for six central principles (‘basic rules’) for conflict resolution: 1. the return of five of the seven provinces surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani sovereignty; 2. an interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh (pending a final settlement) that guarantees security and self-determination for its population; 3. a corridor between the Republic of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh (the so-called Lachin Corridor, note by R.B.); 4. the future settlement of Nagorno-Karabakh’s status through a legally binding expression of will by the parties to the conflict; 5. the right of all displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes; and 6. international security guarantees and peacekeeping.Point 1 was settled with the outcome of the war on 10 November 2020, as all seven districts were recaptured from Azerbaijan and awarded to Azerbaijan in the temporary ceasefire. The remaining points are open, although point 5 seems relatively consensual, at least rhetorically.c) The South Tyrol model would be a durable and constitutionally anchored territorial autonomous self-administration of Nagorno-Karabakh including ethnic proportionalities (proportional representation model in the government and public administration) and international safeguards for stabilisation despite possibly further micro- and meso-conflicts. Following this model, the thrust towards lasting pacification could be, in addition to the six Madrid Principles, which in themselves remain only transitional orientations for containment: a regional, far-reaching autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh with primary and secondary legislative rights within Azerbaijan, possibly in partial aspects also for the seven districts now (again) under Azerbaijani administration, in order to promote regional unity and reconciliation. The South Tyrol model was publicly brought up by Azerbaijani President Ilhan Aliyev as a possible conflict resolution strategy in October 2020, which led to both parties to the conflict temporarily calling on Italy as a mediating power. Yet in Nagorno-Karabakh, as in the South Tyrol conflict, the attitude of the protecting power is also decisive: in the case of South Tyrol, it was Austria. In the case of Nagorno-Karabakh, the situation is complicated by the fact that there are two protecting powers: Russia and Turkey. In addition, the role of Iran remainsTerritorial self-government based on autonomy while belonging to one of the conflict states may be a viable path for Nagorno-Karabakh that promises success. The South Tyrol model is a good template for this. It is also a pluri-ethnic mountain area and offers both sides the narrative of a success story, so that it can lend some legitimacy to the proponents of territorial autonomy from the outset.On the other hand, there are the differences in the historical, political, cultural and religious backgrounds. As ideal-typical as the South Tyrol model seems to “fit” at first glance, in times of “re-globalisation” much depends on contextualisation and “glocalisation”, if they are not even decisive. Any success of implementation depends crucially on the will of all sides as well as the surrounding historical situation. This will to implement the South Tyrol model of territorial autonomy is currently lacking, especially among the winners, while among the losers trauma-favoured “revenge” fantasies prevail. From this perspective, the South Tyrol model will not be directly applicable, but the discussion about it can contribute to stabilising the situation as a process and developmental perspective. In the coming years, this could lead to a declaration of principles as well as tentative work on the adaptation of various clauses and mechanisms.As a precondition for this, a joint invitation of delegations from all three territories involved could be issued: Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan and Armenia could visit South Tyrol to have a direct look at the autonomy model in practice, its achievements, opportunities and limits, preferably in cooperation and exchange with the governments in Rome and Vienna. Representatives of Eurac Research and the South Tyrolean provincial administration could advise the conflict parties and the powers behind them. For such consultations, Eurac Research founded its own specialized centre in February 2019, the “Eurac Center for Autonomy Experience”, which at the same time represents a bridge between science and the provincial administration. Within the framework of this centre, representatives of the conflict parties could be invited to South Tyrol with sustainability-oriented preparation and follow-up. If helpful, this process could also involve the South Tyrolean EU parliamentarian Herbert Dorfmann, who is President of the European Parliamentary Society as well as a board member of the European People’s Party (EPP).However, previous experiences of autonomy in Nagorno-Karabakh have been rather changeable to negative. Autonomies have been promised, granted in part and taken away again. For any durable autonomy solution, much depends on the concrete territorial distribution of the ethnic groups – do they live mixed into each other or separated according to groups? Since today 99% of the Nagorno-Karabakh population is Armenians, and given that in the surrounding districts live mainly Azerbaijanis, principles of the South Tyrol autonomy such as the so-called “ethnic proportional representation” are hardly applicable. This principle provides for the distribution of income and posts in the state administration according to ethnic criteria. With only 1% Azerbaijanis, however, this is hardly relevant in Nagorno-Karabakh, but could nevertheless be a sign of goodwill. Despite these restrictions, however, self-administration is feasible in principle, including territorial fiscal sovereignty if suitable.A major obstacle is, unlike in South Tyrol where all conflict sides were Catholic, the non-identical religion of both sides involved, with an Islam that is in crisis internationally (Fareed Zakaria) and a more militant interpretation of Christianity on the other side. Then, while in settling the South Tyrol dispute all sides involved were democracies, there is the non- or semi-democracy on both sides and in both background powers Russia and Turkey. This makes the situation different from the one that led to the foundations of today’s South Tyrol model between 1972 and 1992. At that time, autonomy was negotiated between Austria and Italy – i.e. between two states that were both Catholic, both democracies and where there was a will to reach consensus after the experience of war. As Erhard Crome has aptly pointed out, in the case of Southwas no religious charge to the conflict – everyone was Catholic. And: today there is the EU as an umbrella over the whole thing (as over Alsace-Lorraine): all are citizens of the Union, pay with the same euro and the borders are open. All of that is missing in the Caucasus region and this is a way contributes to the conflict charge.Other differences are the South Tyrol concept of “dynamic autonomy”, i.e. its constant and conscious evolution explicitly inbuilt in its founding strategy, which runs counter to the partial interests of both sides. Another hurdle is that in South Tyrol the police and military are reserved for the state of Italy. This may appear to many in post-war Nagorno-Karabakh as a usurpation and could make the acceptance of an autonomy arrangement without its own police power questionable. Basically, however, this is actually a misunderstanding of what autonomy is: a compromise solution. Autonomy in the sense of the South Tyrol arrangement means, for all its opportunities, to parts of its population to be part of a nation with a different cultural identity and history. A final problem is the lack of involvement of civil society in the pacification process. Or as Uwe Halbach put it:The OSCE mediation in the conflict is taking place at a high diplomatic level. Civil society forces are insufficiently involved in the process. In an authoritarian state like Azerbaijan, non-governmental organisations have a hard time, and this applies all the more to actors who advocate dialogue with the conflict opponent. But on the Armenian side, too, peace activists encounter considerable reservations. There is a high degree of mistrust on both sides and an extremely low degree of willingness to compromise. These mental barriers were further hardened by the ‘April War’ of 2016. After the change of power through the ‘Velvet Revolution’ in Armenia, there was a brief period of détente in 2018, with signals of willingness to compromise in [the two capitals] Yerevan and Baku. But already at the beginning of 2019, the tone became harsher again and the fronts hardened again.Overall, one question still begs: is there room for political initiative? From the current perspective, the question can only be answered inadequately. The complicated situation requires further negotiations and clarifications. In the medium to long term, however, it is likely that without a tailor-made autonomy solution for Nagorno-Karabakh, the conflict will continue to smoulder, regardless of the willingness or unwillingness of those in power. The international community should not wait for new revanchisms to ignite. The domestic political escalation of the situation in Armenia after the lost war of 2020, with an “attempted military coup” in February 2021 denounced by the head of government Nikol Pashinyan after the Armenian military sided with the political opposition and demanded Pashinyan’s resignation, was a serious warning sign. How US President Joe Biden’s announcement in April 2021 that the mass murders of Armenians in the 20th century would be classified as genocide will affect Turkey’s behaviour in the region also remains to be seen. Similarly, French president Emmanuel Macron’s response in the same month that “Armenia and France will be forever tied together” could have effects on the further development of the dispute.The perspective is limited. The EU can mainly become active and score points with the trump card of the South Tyrol model. For lasting success, diplomatic or intergovernmental reconciliation gestures are not enough. Painstaking detailed work on the ground is necessary. One thing for sure will continue to hold true in Nagorno-Karabakh: History is a superhuman process made by human beings. Any conflict resolution strategy on the ground will have to move consciously in the paradoxical field of tension between what is possible and what cannot beReading on E-International RelationsOpinion – International Law versus Realpolitik in the Nagorno-Karabakh ConflictNagorno Karabakh: Armenia’s Claims, Azerbaijan’s Position, and the Peace EffortsParliamentary Diplomacy as ‘Track 1 1/2 Diplomacy’ in Conflict ResolutionConflict Resolution and the UN Peacekeeping Operation in Côte d’IvoireEducating Conflict Management and Practicing Peacebuilding: The Case of LebanonSustaining Peace and Internal Self-Determination in the UN PerspectiveAbout The Author(s)Dr. Roland Benedikter is Co-Head of the Center for Advanced Studies of Eurac Research Bozen-Bolzano, Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Italy, and Research Professor for Multidisciplinary Policy Analysis in residence at the Willy Brandt Center of the University of Wroclaw-Breslau, Poland.TagsConflict ResolutionNagorno-KarabakhTerritorial Autonomy"
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/14/chile-and-the-overcoming-of-neoliberalism-countering-authoritarianism-and-the-self-regulated-market/,Chile and the Overcoming of Neoliberalism: Countering Authoritarianism and the Self-Regulated Market,Felipe Costa Lima,Jul 14 2021,"Chile was a foundational laboratory of neoliberalism, and one of the most challenging experiences of human history. According to David Harvey (2008, 19-20), neoliberals described neoliberalism as the fulfilment of economic liberty. Aligned with a civil-military dictatorship notwithstanding, neoliberalism did not only destroy the dynamic infrastructure of Chile, but also encouraged the implementation and legitimation of an autocratic regime which profoundly favored both Chilean and transnational bourgeoisies’ interests.Following Harvey again (2008, 20-1), the process which led to the expansion of neoliberalism as the new economic orthodoxy followed an unusual path. The spread of neoliberal organic intellectuals worldwide, mainly in Latin America, counted on the generous support of US investments, as well as the Chilean national bourgeoisie. Neoliberalism had few supporters in the 1940s, but the Mont Pelerin Society, which comprised Friedrich von Hayek, Ludwig von Mises, Milton Friedman and even Karl Popper for some time, was one of them. Already in the 1950s, the US awarded scholarships for Latin America’s economists as a Cold War program planned to neutralise leftist tendencies in the region. During the next decades, those Chilean economists formed mainly by the University of Chicago became predominant in the private Catholic University of Santiago in the 1970s (Panitch and Gindin 2011). It was also during this decade that Neoliberalism gained academic respectability, mainly because of the ‘Nobel Prize’ in Economics attributed to Hayek and Friedman in 1974 and 1976, respectively, even though these prizes were controlled by the Swiss Banking bourgeoisie and were not connected to the mainstream Nobel PrizeSpecific characterisations of neoliberalism are difficult due to clear deviations from its theoretical model and adaptations from place to place and time to time. Nonetheless, in general neoliberalism claims that human well-being can be best advanced by unlocking individual entrepreneurial freedoms and capacities within an institutional framework characterised by powerful rights to private property, free markets and trade. From this angle, private property and investments would increase human dignity and individual freedom, inasmuch as they are the keys for innovation and richness creation. Further, market institutions with free functioning and law regimes would provide a ‘neutral’ background for preserving and prompting the efficiency of the market to society’s well-being, even if by violent methods (Harvey 2008, 5-6).Besides fascism and communism, state planning itself is an obstacle for enacting neoliberal objectives. Then deindustrialisation, privatisations, deregulations and the reform of labour codes are essential steps for handing over to the private sector the key role in leading society’s destinies (Silva 2012, 1-2).The freedom that regulation creates is denounced as unfreedom; the justice, freedom, and well-being it offers are reduced to the camouflage of slavery. (Neoliberalism is the) fullness of freedom for those who do not need to improve their income, their free time and their security, and a mere veneer of freedom for the people, who may try in vain to use their democratic rights to protect themselves from the power of those who own the property (Harvey 2008, 36).Paradoxically, states were not weakened, but their institutional structures were invaded and appropriated by private interests, which aim at preserving the quality and integrity of money through the indisputable defence of private properties and the creation of new markets, such as water, education, health, and socialidea that states had withdrawn from the economy amidst the globalization of capitalism was a neoliberal ideological myth, as states in the developed capitalist countries at the centre of global finance pumped more money into the banks, while they ensured that in the developing countries crises were generally used to impose financial and market discipline on their populations (Panitch and Gindin 2011, 11)The establishment of military structures for ensuring these bourgeois rights was an opportune line of action, as social movements, notably trade unions, resisted these attempts of accumulation by expropriation (Harvey 2008, 70-2; Silva 2012, 13-21). Since a perpetual governance by ‘experts’ is the primordial goal of neoliberalism, transnational and domestic bourgeoisies seek to distance key institutions from democratic pressures, e.g. central banks, as well as to enforce restrictions over progressive interpretations of the state’s constitutional order. In this light, even a formal liberal democratic system can pose threats to the neoliberal hegemony and its ‘shock therapies’ attempts (see Rugitsky 2020, 594-600; Ballestin 2018, 152; Saad-Filho 2011, 252-5). Given its undemocratic measures and results, the preference for the Pinochet dictatorship as a propagandistic laboratory of neoliberalism is not a surprise, insofar as bureaucratic impediments from the public sector and the social countermovement of resistance could be handled in an ‘easier’ way by the bourgeoisie and its allies.Civil-military coup d’état and neoliberal hegemonyChile was a case in which a military regime headed by Pinochet was willing to switch the organisation of the economy from a top-down to a bottom-up performance. And in that process, a group of people who have been trained at the University of Chicago in the Department of Economics who came to be called the Chicago Boys played a major role in designing and implementing the economic reforms. The real miracle in Chile was not that those economic reforms worked so well. Chile is by all odds the best success story in Latin America today. The real miracle is not that those economic arrangements worked so well because that is what Adam Smith said. The real miracle is that a military hunter was willing to let them do it. (…) that process led to a situation in which you were able to get an election which ended the military handgun, and you now have a democratic government (Friedman 2013).The goal of this section is to undo Friedman’s statement about neoliberalism. In 1970, Salvador Allende became the first socialist president democratically elected in the world, which could jeopardise United States’ capitalist hegemonic influence in Latin America. Since the inception of Allende’s term in Chile, the government of Richard Nixon (1969-74) has sought to destabilise the Chilean government, both through economic restrictions and imperial influences. After an initial attempt of coup d’état against Allende in June 1973, general Prats renounced and indicated general Augusto Pinochet for his post, owing to his professional and ‘apolitical’ character (Coggiola 2018). However, backed by the Chilean right-wing forces, the bourgeoisie and American power élites such as multinational corporations, the CIA and Henry Kissinger (Harvey 2008), Pinochet headed an attack to the presidential palace in Santiago. Allende refused all offers of asylum from foreign nations, and when the militaries invaded the palace he shot himself to death (Coggiola 2018).Along with a fierce political repressive state, which carried out a regime of terror within the country, neoliberalism played a fundamental legitimacy role to the Pinochet regime in the eyes of the capitalist hegemony. With the aid of the Chicago Boys, Pinochet promoted structural adjustments within the country, notably the full privatisation of state assets but copper, since the control of this commodity was paramount for financing the state coercive apparatus (Harvey 2008, 1-9). It is opportune to claim that Pinochet rhetorically condemned the nationalisation of the copper industry during the Allende government; nevertheless, after Allende’s brutal seizure, Pinochet maintained it and centralised the production of copper in one state enterprise, Codelco, which provides Chile’s biggest exporting profits to date (Palacios 2018). Then, besides the withdrawal of the barriers concerning foreign investments, the Pinochet dictatorship privatised the exploration of almost everything, including fishing and wood extraction (Harvey 2008, 8). In 1980, this dictatorial government privatised even Chileans’ pensions, notably those from the civil public sector. Although the government guaranteed Chileans would receive 70% of their active salary, reality crushed them, considering that they actually gained about 37% of their active salary after retirement. Moreover, it is opportune to state that pension privatisation was set up only for civilians, given that the military received 100% of their active salary after retirement, besides having worked less time (Palaciosimmediate recovery of the Chilean economy in terms of growth rates, capital accumulation and high rates of return on foreign investment in the 1970s was short-lived. As a result, loans from the IMF were necessary for stabilising Chile’s trade balance deficit (Harvey 2008, 8). The Latin America debt crisis also played a crucial role in this economic riddle. Transnational and Chilean bourgeoisie accomplished to fully capture Chile’s state apparatus through the 1980 constitution, which constitutionalised the primary surplus imperative of the neoliberal tradition along with authoritarian mechanisms for keeping the military influence over politics (see Saad-Filho 2011, 244; Andrade 2019, 127-131). The ideologue of this constitution, Jaime Guzmán, was an admirer of Franco, and was dismayed at the news that the Spanish dictator’s regime had been dismantled only a few years after his death. Therefore, he attempted (and succeeded) to enact a long-term regime which would survive and protect neoliberal policies and human rights violations even in a democracy. For example, high quorums were necessary for every reform, and private solutions for public issues such as education, health, and social security became perennial.The Chilean countermovementAccording to the sociologist Manuel Canales (in Montes 2020), the authoritarian regime had a ‘pressure cooker’ effect over the elected élites, since the distance between electors’ wishes and the policies that could be adopted by those who were elected increased significantly. The generational gap of those who were born in a formal democratic regime also strengthened this feeling. According to a Social Panorama of Latin America report (2019, 57) produced by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the richest 1% of the Chilean population kept 26.5% of the country’s wealth in 2017, while 50% of low-income families represented only 2.1% of net wealth. This ‘pressure cooker’ exploded in October 2019 when, based on the recommendation of a ‘panel of public transport experts’, Sebastián Piñera’s government decided to increase the price of subway tickets (see Montes 2020; BBC 2019).From October to November 2019, social convulsion and violence affected Chile, and demanding agendas ensued from the protests. The Chilean example reflects an impressive institutional strategy for rebuffing destructive hegemonies: a plebiscite to decide on a new constitution.The ‘Agreement for peace and the new constitution’ called for the launch of a popular consultation in April 2020 on two issues: whether a new constitution is desired and what kind of body should write this new constitution, a mixed constitutional convention or a constitutional convention or assembly. The mixed constitutional convention, endorsed by the right-wing coalition government parties, would comprise 50% by members elected for this purpose and 50% by incumbent parliamentarians. On the other hand, the “constituent assembly”, supported by the opposition parties, must have all its members chosen specifically for the occasion (DW 2019).With an electoral participation of 51% (in Chile voting is optional), the greatest number in Chile’s history, the choice for a new constitution won by a wide margin (78%). Chileans decided for the election of a specific constitutional convention grounded in gender equality and to write a new foundational law. The new law was promulgated in May 2021 and gave victory to the left-wing and independent politicians (52 seats to the left-wing, 48 to independent candidates, 38 to the unified right-wing and 17 reserved to indigenous people’s representatives). For what pertains to the independent candidates, they are often related to a wide range of social areas, such as education, social justice, environment, and feminism. Among others, the election of Elisa Loncón, an indigenous Mapuche leader, as the president of the new Constitutional Assembly (Colombo 2021), is an outstanding result which may lend to the third constitutional ‘Plurinational’ state in Latin America, after Ecuador andOverwhelming inequalities and the threats posed to democracy by monopolist transnational enterprises, particularly social media and far right candidates, brought about a forewarning in the Global North that neoliberal policies may have gone too far. However, despite the economic and representative crises of neoliberalism worldwide, neoliberal governance policies continue to be employed due to their efficacy in capturing states’ interests and in transforming social practices and psychologies (see Ballestin 2018, 154-7; Andrade 2019, 112-4).Neoliberalism makes up itself as a zone of audacious experimentation and failure, always imposing a shameful re-regulation by the State. Neoliberalism cannot exist purely, nor can it completely undo the social and institutional formations that preceded it, needing to parasitize them in order to survive. Given the necessary incompleteness of its process and its hybrid nature, neoliberalism can always re-blame the state and heterogeneous formations. And so, as a theory of the crisis, it can once again offer itself as a remedy for the ills it unleashes, allowing it to keep making mistakes (Andrade 2019, 122)The G7 states agreement for taxing transnational companies seems to be an initial step for washing out neoliberalism’s economic and ideological contents (at least in the Global North) (DN 2021). Clearly, more humane policies in the Global North do not imply their replication in the Global South, since, referring to Latin America, the nation-state commodity-exporter project has always been prioritised by their own national and the international bourgeoisies. In this light, the concept of post-democracy (see Crouch 2013) applied to the North has not the same meaning to the South, due to different global developments of capitalism, liberalism, and democracy (see Ballestin 2018, 158-160; Rugitsky 2020). For example, Chile will write in 2021 its first fully democratic constitution in history, as the other three were ‘granted’ by autocratic and/or undemocratic regimes.At the domestic level, Chile seems to be a more stable nation-state than most of its Latin America’s neighbours (Anibal Quijano 2005, 121-2). During the 19th century, Chilean territorial expansion at the expense of Bolivia and Peru allowed the country to control important primary products, such as nitrate and copper, which triggered the formation of trade unions and a substantial white middle class. Therefore, the concentration of Chile’s production of independent products based on wage workers not only expanded its internal market, but also its democratisation process. Besides, by excluding indigenous and black peoples and encouraging their genocide, the formation of a homogeneous cultural white nation-state produced more stability and democracy in Chilean’s domestic affairs. Finally, the public sentencing and condemnation of authoritarian figures of the 1973-1990 Chilean civil-military dictatorship has generated a thorough consensus in the whole political spectrum, namely that authoritarian solutions are no more admissible (see Folha 2019; Pinheiro 2019).Chile can leave behind both neoliberalism and authoritarianism without a major crisis if the following conditions will apply: (1) a weaker international pressure from neoliberal markets, and (2) an institutionalized democratic countermovement. The challenge of the Chilean left-wing appears to be twofold: holding its institutional force and expanding its ideological apparatus after implementing a welfare state constitution – given that independent candidates from the civil society are publicly asserting their distance from traditional politics. Furthermore, neoliberalism is not already over, and the Brazilian example shows that a ‘Citizen Constitution’ can change into a neoliberal draft in just a couple of decades."

First, support Fernandez’s government regarding the donation of more than twenty million vaccines to Argentina. And, second, serve as a diplomatic liaison to renegotiate Argentina’s debt with the IMF – the conditions of which the COVID-19 pandemic has only worsened. In an attempt to express his gratitude, President Fernandez declared, supposedly quoting Mexican Nobel Prize Laureate Octavio Paz, ‘The Mexicans came from the Indians, the Brazilians came from the jungle, but we Argentines came from ships. And they were ships that came from Europe’. The statement, according to Fernandez, was aimed at strengthening and emphasizing the cultural ties between Spain and Argentina.While many journalists and political analysts in Argentina have focused on the origin of Fernandez’s quote, some referring to Argentinian Litto Nebbia’s 1982 song ‘Llegamos de los barcos’ (Clarín), which includes the lyric ‘Los brasileros salen de la selva/los mejicanos vienen de los indios/pero nosotros los argentinos/llegamos de los barcos’ (Brazilians came out of the jungle/Mexicans came out from the Indians/But we Argentinians/Arrived in the ships). No one can deny that Nebbia’s lyrics resonate with declarations made several times by Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges, who often expressed that ‘we Argentines are Europeans living in exile,’ which was Borges’s way to distinguish between Argentinian ‘criollos’ (Latin Americans with a European heritage) and the indigenous people from the Americas by focusing on skin coloration, ethnic phenotype, and cultural expressions. These are the deeply racialized foundations of Latin America which still prevail throughout the entire American continent.Regardless of the exact origin and intention of President Fernandez’s declaration, the quote recalls a long-lasting historical debate. There isn’t any doubt that Latin America is a cultural, ethnic, and epistemological crucible. Argentina isn’t an exception, just as scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith points out in Decolonizing Methodologies, when referring to global regions and nation-states where indigenous and Western worldviews keep colliding as the cultural and ideological byproducts of ‘a vast history and on multiple traditions of knowledge incorporating cultural views of reality, time and space’ (Smith 2021, 67).Nevertheless, the current financial crisis that Argentina is facing has nothing to do with identity politics or leftist economic measures. It is an intrinsic consequence of the neoliberalization introduced by former President Carlos Menem in the 1990s. President Alberto Fernandez’s mishap in using the aforementioned words has compromised Argentina’s diplomatic relations with Mexico and Brazil.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/11/analyzing-views-of-the-ease-of-legal-immigration-from-mexico-into-the-us/,Analyzing Views of the Ease of Legal Immigration from Mexico into the US,"Madelynn Einhorn, Isabel Pergande, Aurora Speltz and Timothy S. Rich",Jul 11 2021,"While over the past 20 years clear majorities of Americans view immigration overall as good for the country, immigration policy remains contentious, especially as the U.S. experiences an uptick in the number of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. While the supposed ‘surge’ at the border has been attributed to seasonal changes in immigration patterns and COVID-19 related policy, the Biden administration still faces an undeniable hurdle in attempting to craft bipartisan immigration reform. The Biden administration has been criticized by both parties for an ineffective strategy at the U.S.-Mexico border, with Republicans claiming his strategy is too lenient and Democrats claiming Biden’s policy is too harsh and inhumane.The Trump administration prioritized prosecuting undocumented immigrants and building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Images of poor conditions in detention centers and children being separated from their families resulted in political uproar, particularly among Democrats. The partisan divide in attitudes towards immigrants and immigration policy continues to widen. In fact, since 2016, Republican support for deportation of the undocumented has increased by two points, while Democratic support has dropped by 10 points. While Biden has claimed he will reform immigration policy, families are still being separated. With President Biden’s promise not to separate families, some immigrants waiting in camps in Northern Mexico are sending their children unaccompanied to the border, knowing they will not be turned away. This difficult decision suggests that many Mexican citizens are unable to find a simple, legal route to immigrate to the U.S.While many public opinion surveys focus on American perceptions of immigration, Mexican perceptions of the issue are often neglected. Although more Mexicans have left the U.S. than have come each year for the past 15 years, Mexicans still represent the largest migrant population in the U.S. Qualifying for legal status can be very difficult as immigrants must be sponsored by an employer or family member (parent, child, sibling, spouse) who has legal status or is a U.S. citizen. Employers must justify employing an immigrant by searching for U.S. citizens or Legal Permanent Residents to fill the job first. Quotas also exist, prohibiting more than a set number of people from entering the US from any one country per year, resulting in significant delays to enter the country legally. The Immigration and Nationality Act has a cap of 675,000 permanent resident visas each year, with additional immigrants allowed if they are family-based immigrants. However, this cap is insufficient to meet demand for permanent residency status, and the U.S. mandates a per-country cap where no country, including Mexico, can receive more than 7% of family-based or employment visas.Asylum seekers on the US-Mexico border often have to wait weeks or months in brutal conditions before entering the country. Some migrants have even died from dehydration while attempting to cross the Southern border. Many migrants are desperate to escape dangerous conditions by coming to the U.S. – when legal pathways fail, many must turn to illicit routes. In 2014, of immigrants who had immediate concerns of persecution and turned to the U.S. for asylum, only 5% actually received it, while almost half were deported.We contend that the discussions about immigrating legally actually confounds broader immigration reform. While few historically openly state blanket opposition to immigration, with most Americans having ancestral ties to immigrants, many argue that immigrants should only pursue legal routes, like their family members did decades prior. However, many ancestors might not have been authorized had today’s restrictions been in place. U.S. immigration policy was largely open, with very few federal restrictions on immigration until the late 19th century. Quotas and nationality restrictions were not implemented until the 1920s. Mexico is especially impacted by quotas: according to a 2018 Pew Research study, approximately 25% of immigrants in the U.S. were from Mexico, and Mexico, with 120,000 immigrants, was the third most cited country of origin for new immigrants. Moreover, this focus on legal immigration assumes a transparent and coherent path that amounts to a metaphorical waiting one’s turn inassess whether people evaluate legal immigration differently based on nationality, we conducted original national web surveys in both the U.S. and Mexico via Qualtrics, using quota sampling, on June 24–26. Funding for these surveys was provided by the Mahurin Honors College at Western Kentucky University. We asked 625 respondents in both countries “In your opinion, is it easy for Mexicans to immigrate legally to the US?”. This sets aside the thornier issue of crossing the border illegally as well as focusing the attention on what presumably a majority of Americans would view as an acceptable path.The results are clear: while American respondents were near evenly split on the question, roughly 78% of Mexicans said legal immigration was not easy. While stark, this is consistent with Mexican citizens being more likely to know someone who has immigrated to the U.S. However, the discrepancy hints at a perceptual problem in the U.S. that potential immigrants should follow the legal process, unaware of the complexities involved.We next disaggregated the data by partisanship in the U.S., where we see a clear majority of Democrats (61.65%) who believe legal immigration is not easy, while a nearly identical majority of Republicans (61.09%) believe it is easy. Those not identifying with either party were slightly more likely to think legal immigration is easy. Similarly, we analyzed the partisan breakdown of data from the survey in Mexico across the four main political parties (PRI, PAN, MORENA, PT). Despite minor variations across the four groups, an overwhelming majority claim legal immigration is not easy, with the highest rate among President Obrador’s MORENA party. Extending this to supporters of the PRD and PVEM, smaller parties with fewer survey respondents, finds largely similar results.So what explains the consensus in Mexico but not the U.S.? One reason could be that Mexican citizens are more familiar with the immigration experience, if not the legal immigration process. It is worth noting that once an immigrant has entered the U.S. illegally, they cannot apply to adjust their status to that of a Lawful Permanent Resident. Many immigrants, therefore, have no path to legal status in the U.S., whether or not they wish to become documented. Approximately half of Mexican respondents knew someone who had been deported from the U.S., likely influencing Mexican respondents’ thoughts of the process to legally immigrate. Most Americans likely have little knowledge of the difficulty of immigration or how the process works because they have limited personal experience.Another reason could be that American views of legal immigration generally shape views of Mexican immigration. The U.S. survey also asked respondents to answer “yes” or “no” to “I support legal immigration.” Here we find respondents nearly evenly split with 49.6% supporting legal immigration. However, compared to those in support of legal immigration, those opposing legal immigration were 6.25% more likely to say Mexican legal immigration is easy (52.38% overall). Our survey also found that while a majority of Americans supported deporting documented and undocumented immigrants that committed various crimes, over a quarter of respondents were supportive of deporting documented immigrants when no criminal activity had been mentioned. While this could be due to confusion over the term documented, it suggests a sizable segment of the population unsupportive of even legal routes to immigration.Overall, the vastly different perspectives between American and Mexican respondents on legal pathways into the U.S. affect the development of cohesive immigration reform. Unauthorized immigration has been a reality in America for generations, but we have only fairly recently increased federal regulations of immigration, restricting the number and types of people that may enter. Still, Americans remain largely positive towards immigration, with 71% of Americans indicating that immigrants are an important part of our national identity.If the goal is to promote legal immigration, broader understanding of legal hurdles as well as differentiating between documented and undocumented immigration is1Figure 2Figure 3"
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/09/kill-empowerment-the-proliferation-of-remotely-piloted-vehicles/,Kill Empowerment: The Proliferation of Remotely Piloted Vehicles,Scott N Romaniuk and Tobias Burgers,Jul 9 2021,"The proliferation of remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) and remote/robotic weapons systems (RWS) in the form of armed drones, and states’ capacities to engage in the practice of targeted killings by means of armed drones (hereafter, “drone kills”) continues to expand (Callamard and Rogers, 2020). This article will analyze armed drone proliferation at the structural level by addressing four key elements as drivers of lethal autonomous weapons systems proliferation: the plasticity of killing via drones (i.e., the empowerment of capabilities or what we refer to as “kill empowerment”), the systems, the expertise (or guidance by knowledge brokers), and the material instruments employed for the performance of “targeted killings” or “precision killings”. Our analysis resides on two broad levels: those of state exporters and importers. We apply these proliferation mechanisms to the People’s Republic of China (PRC, hereafter China) as a drone exporter and to Nigeria as a drone importer. In the company of the conditions presented, we posit that the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) has supported China’s entry into the drone market with the MTCR’s recent revamping subsequently exhibiting (still in an embryonic phase) a negative recoil effect that is likely to bring more drones into the global market, intensifying armed drone proliferation.These instruments and the larger systems to which they belong go by a variety of names: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), autonomous weapons systems (AWS), lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), and lesser-used vernacular or colloquial labels such as “robot(ic) weapons”, “killer (ro)bots)”, “killer drones”, “slaughterbots”, and “obombers”. Considering their potential to reach and perform far beyond the operator’s location, we support the use of the term “autonomous weapons systems” but opt for using the term “remotely piloted vehicles” or simply “drones”. We also draw a distinction between automated instruments operated by remote means and those instruments and systems that are totally independent or autonomous. While we acknowledge a progression towards fully independent or autonomous drones, our subsequent argument and analysis resides in the understanding that drone operators remain in full control of their machines and determine the courses of action of their armed instruments.The Military Drone Age: Producers and ExportersIn stride with the United States, Israel, Russia, Turkey, China, India, Iran, the United Kingdom, and France are among the more than 100 countries that have an active drone inventory, and the 40 or so that possess drones and are currently seeking to weaponize them (United Nations General Assembly, UNGA, 2010; Callamard and Rogers 2020). The United States and Israel have demonstrated the flexible utility of armed drones: they can be used in distant locations (from the safety of the home state), used with relatively low (material) costs to the operating state, present little-to-no risk to military personnel, and leave scant immediate trace-evidence of a strike, at least beyond the immediate strike region and surrounding communities. As more states develop drone technology and work to weaponize their version of them, it was inevitable that other states in the international system would eventually use this form of security technology as the United State and Israel have (Ephron 2006; UNGA 2010; see Schmid 2018).The United States and Israel are near-universally acknowledged leaders in armed drone development, production, and export. As Calhoun (2018: 358 and 362) notes, “Israel was the first drone-killer nation, having fired missiles from drones against suspected Palestinian terrorists, primarily in the Gaza strip” with the United States following closely behind and setting a new precedent for secret and indiscriminate killing and destruction of human targets regarded as “‘imminent threats’ to the people of the United States and were destroyed by missile strikes because capture was ‘infeasible’”.Restrictions placed on their sale, however, through the US Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) Policy, initially limited the proliferation of the practice of drone warfare, confining it to these two major (in)security actors. The CAT Policy, approved in early 2018, reflected US security ambitions in numerous regions, its desire to protect advanced (military) technology, reservations over undermining the its arms industry, and concerns (as indicated by its government) about the “risk[s] of adverse economic, political or social impact within the recipient nation and the degree to which security needs can be addressed by other means” (United States Department of State 2009). A major shift in restrictions occurred in 2020 under the Trump Administration, when it updated the rules concerning the sale of armed drones. This was partially a response to Israeli and Chinese drone sales and to those states’ access and inroads into international markets. As part of the Trump Administration’s initiative, renovation of the rules governing the 35-state MTCR regime were underway inthe pioneer of “unmanned” aircraft, Israel developed into the principal exporter ofthis technology between 2010 and 2014 (Bodner 2014; Haaretz 2018). Although an official member of the MTCR abiding by its rules, Israel interprets the regime’s provisions uniquely, thus serving as a condition that has contributed to Israel’s continued drone sales. Israeli drones could be armed by states that have purchased them. Israel’s drone sales have equipped more than 50 countries with its machines, but these countries remain unidentified (O’Gorman and Abbott 2013). In their 2017 report, Ewers, Fish, Horowitz, Sander, and Scharre (2017: 8) noted that, “Israel is the top exporter of military drones, accounting for over 60 percent of international transfers over the past three decades…”. Israel’s internal security situation prefigured significantly in its embrace of kill operations using sophisticated military device such as jets, helicopters, and drones carrying mainly Hellfire missiles. The Hellfire missile has a blast or “kill radius” of approximately 15 meters and a “wound-radius” of 20 meters. Shrapnel and objects can reach even further, causing extensive injury, depending on the surroundings and number of people in the vicinity. As we show later, we see a similar embrace of these instruments in the case study.China’s sales of armed drones satisfy an almost natural demand that has surfaced due to arms sales regulations and barriers on specific types of weaponry and technology, notably the policy and regime stated. Where states could not access the coveted equipment from other nations, China as a builder, but more importantly as a seller despite having also become a member of the MTCR, filled this vacuum. Although China’s drones are arguably of lesser-quality compared to its American and Israeli counterparts and are the result of spin-off drone technology (in part), they have come to be highly attractive options for states facing the restrictions we address. Alongside its Wing Loong I (Yilong/Pterodactyl) machines, China’s successive editions carry and deliver significant munitions payloads and operate for extended periods of time, covering vast expanses of terrain. They carry a variety of weapons, giving its operator many options for attacking soldiers, armored vehicles, “high-value targets” (HVTs). As further variants of Chinese drones are developed, their capabilities and overall quality have risen while their costs have remained extremely low. An already-materialized demand has only matured as few restrictions on sales exist and mutually beneficial seller-buyer relationships continue to emerge.In late 2020, Russia’s state media, RIA Novosti (2020), publicized news of Russia’s armed drone developments. Russia’s armed drone, which goes by the name “Orion”, successfully fired its small S-5 guided missile, marking the development of its fully developed armed drone capable of kill missions. Russia’s Ministry of Defense, in cooperation with private firms, continues to advance Russia’s autonomous weapons systems, with prospects of enhanced systems and weapons trials through 2021. However, Russia has previously filled only a slender role in the export and proliferation of armed drones and their systems but has invested considerably in its research. Thus, with the advent of its latest product, Russia will likely be more active in drone proliferation. But for now, Russia can be identified as a “nascent proliferator” of armed drones.NigeriaNigeria’s acquisition of drones extends from a range of factors that include structural barriers, unanticipated opportunity, and a shift in geostrategic security imperatives. Boko Haram (BH), Ansaru (or al-Qaeda in the Land Beyond the Sahel), and ISIS West Africa (ISIS-WA) operate primarily in Nigeria’s northeastern region, with the majority of attacks from the former occurring in 2013, 2014, and 2015. Following a moderate ebb, the frequency of attacks has risen since 2019, with Islamic militancy in Nigeria exceeding the 2014-2015 peak (African Center for Strategic Studies 2020). BH’s profile of violence has included thousands of deaths (mainly civilians), hundreds of abductions, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of vulnerable people. These factors are the central foundations of Nigerian military and the policymakers’ underlying logic for the recent adoption of armed drones (Senior officer in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, April 19,United States has not treated Nigeria the same way it has treated states like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, among other where United States drone operations are conducted. The is because the kind of terrorism seen in Nigeria, according to a General in the Nigerian Army, is “home-grown and still highly localized”, which has not, “in the medium-term, [shown] any real threats to the American states”. He reasoned that, “[until] only recently America didn’t even call what we [Nigeria] have here as international terrorism. It is domestic terrorism. It is one reason why they have not yet brought in very high-technology” (Brigadier-General in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, April 19, 2016). While Nigeria possesses both drones and an active “space command” that uses drones, they are not American (Brigadier-General in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, April 19, 2016). Rather, they are older versions only capable of surveillance and have been considerably neglected. Some local drones have not even been flown.Nigeria has recently incorporated armed drones into its CT toolbox with the purchase of Wing Loong machines (Senior officer in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, January 10, 2021). We explain this procurement vis-à-vis several factors. First, the threat posed by BH and local insurgents has increased. Second, the United States has distanced itself from even the prospect of supplying Nigeria with armed drones, nor does it conduct its own drone kills in the country. Three, obstacles associated with American and Israeli drones have not been reflected in the Chinese dimension. Instead, the Chinese drone option points to the inverse: readily available and usable, reliable, cutting-edge, and untrammeled by the scrutiny associated with American regulations and policies (Security analyst, University of Lagos, personal communication, Ibadan, Nigeria, January 15, 2021).Chinese drones are, relative to the operational environment, state-of-the-art and can readily support a state’s CT requirements. As a senior military officer explains, “Nigeria can fulfill two essential CT needs on its own level: putting boots on the ground and maintaining popular support” (Brigadier-General in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, April 19, 2016). Chinese armed drones accentuate the satisfaction of these capabilities while addressing existing needs by demonstrating that the government can combat terrorism and banditry, maintain popular support through its efforts, and optimize the financial dimension of its CT endeavors. Additionally, a practical dimension is the purchasing power that Chinese drones have granted states like Nigeria. “In a sense, it is a kind of proliferation as such as you describe, but not beyond this nation’s borders. We do not operate them outside of Nigeria, unlike as they are doing in those other places: Libya, Yemen, Iraq” (Senior officer in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, January 5, 2021).The Nigeria case illustrates the limitations of civil society in acting as government watch-dogs for the abuse of human rights and the rule of law in armed conflict. Indeed, lethal force in any form during armed conflict is legally permissible as long as the deliverable force is “necessary” and “directly proportional”. However, Nigeria, under President Muhammadu Buhari, and previously President Goodluck Jonathan, reproached many critics including non-profits for allegedly supporting terrorism by serving as conduits of recruitment, funding, and ideological dissemination (Senior member of a civil society organization focusing on human rights, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, January 8, 2021). Whereas the military officers that we interviewed emphasize the importance of their work and the impact of drones on operational (e.g., counter-terrorism, CT) success, an anti-corruption group in Nigeria explains that the vilification of organizations tasked with holding the government accountable, opens a course for unethical CT practices or moral questionability. “The very purpose of rules in times like these”, explains a civil society program officer, “is to assure compliance with standards, precisely to foil wrongdoing by those in charge” (Program officer of a civil society organization focusing on anti-corruption, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, December 6, 2020). “Any discussions between the government and its citizenry and opposition”, explains a member of a group focusing on government transparency, “is outright absent. They will tell you that they are protecting values in place but they restructure the system to fit their domestic policy actions” (Program officer of a civil society organization focusing on anti-corruption, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, December 6,the government might struggle to meet the financial requirements to continue its internal war against terrorism, it is likely to consider alternatives to continue a fight that it cannot afford to halt. To overcome financial limitations and human resource shortages, the Nigerian military has turned to Chinese drone as an alternative to costlier and publicly undesirable means of conducting CT campaigns. “The military budget consumes large fortunes of the state’s funds with delivery of moneys left uncertain and I cannot delay my thanks for the supplies that we need and have received [speaking of drones]” (Senior officer in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, January 5, 2021). As a Colonel in the Nigerian Army notes,the Nigerian military consists of many men and has some necessary equipment, but it pledged itself to plentiful security missions and operations around the country. The armed bandits, pirates, insurgents, and violent gangs require a determined response by way of equipment and we have to understand the nuances in efficient usage of those […] It is now with us that the valuable advantage lies” (Colonel in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Ibadan, Nigeria, April 19, 2016).Thus, the turn to Chinese drones has been rationalized on the basis of utilizing more convenient and efficient weapons that are now available instead of continuing to tolerate human and material costs.DiscussionPersistent asymmetric threats are a significant factor in developing states’ interest and willingness to add armed drones to their CT arsenals. Through our semi-structured interviews, we underscore some key factors in drone proliferation.Geography is one such factor with the others reinforced by this particular characteristic. This is due to topographical challenges acting as practical barriers to government CT operations while simultaneously supporting terrorists and insurgents (Colonel in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Ibadan, Nigeria, April 19, 2016). In Nigeria, oversight and concern for human rights, and possible civilian deaths and injuries are identified as a would-be hindrance to the incorporation of armed drones and practice of drone kills. But this barrier has also proven rather simple to overcome with governments regularly citing the human costs to legitimate armed drone adoption and depicting non-profits as supporters of terrorism. As a political and security analyst in Pakistan reasons on the advantage of armed drones, “it’s a commonsensical thing. It’s to avoid ground losses, and number two, to avoid legal action at home. When you’re employing such a technology then you can’t hold the intelligence [agency] responsible because it’s less obvious, less traceable” (Senior member of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), personal communication, Islamabad, Pakistan, January 8, 2016).In terms of the acquisition of machines and expertise to operate the systems, the logic of state funding (or the absence thereof) is turned on its head given the comparable cost-effective option of Chinese drones. Wing Loong variants are highly advanced weapons for states that would otherwise rely on basic and less-dexterous CT means. Therefore, the argument of drones as the “poor man’s CT weapon” seems to no longer apply, and even modest military budgets can ensure the acquisition not only of drones, but drones in bulk together with special operations-guidance by the experts who designed and built them. This perspective tenders deeper support for the position that replacement needs are no longer encumbering (Senior officer in the Nigerian Army, personal communication, Abuja, Nigeria, January 10, 2021).Low-intensity conflict zones beyond the realm of Western focus are environments in which drone kills proliferate. The perceived negative feedback, as faced by the United States and Israel in such places as Iraq, Afghanistan, the Horn of Africa, and Libya, among other locales, is minimalized by comparison due to the absence of major conflict, coverage, and due to the enablers described. In addition to lowering the threshold for the practice of drone kills, we will likely observe further use of killing with drones as drone-dependent states lean on builder-exporter states’ capacities and relaxing disposition towards sharing their instruments, systems, and knowhow. As such, the American and Israeli practice, and their initiative to perform drone kills, and absence of legal framework limiting them, have established an early and resilient precedent. That precedent of American frontier or “Wild West” lawlessness, even indifference, extends to more nations using the same means to achieve similar goals. Moreover, we identify an extension of killing with drones, facilitating the normalization of armed drone use, or (expanded) “kill empowerment”, in domestic and international settings through the revamping of policies and emergence of new suppliers seeking toperceived and portrayed necessity of combatting terrorism and insurgencies as existential threats to and enemies of humanity have been powerful forces in the narratives for state acquisition and the instrumentality of armed drones. However, in tandem with the symbolic strength portrayed, practical concerns serve armed drone proliferation two decades after the United States’ first drone strike in Afghanistan in 2001 following the launch of its War on Terror. Less-stable and even vulnerable governments and regimes have proven to be enthusiastic buyers ostensibly because drones bring a simple, cost-effective response to serious threats. The confluence of actors involved in armed drone proliferation provide essential elements that connect neatly to the conditions addressed.ConclusionIn this article, we addressed the proliferation of armed drones in two general veins, including those of: manufacturing and exporting states, and states that seeks to procure them. Our argument was nested in a range of discernible conditions such as a paucity of immoral and ethical consideration for armed drone procurement and use, the existence of domestic terrorist threats, insufficient or scarce state financial capacities, and a shortage of the requisite skills and knowledge to operate drone systems and perform the targeted kills. Whereas the United States and Israel were seminal actors in the initial wave of drone proliferation, others have since joined in supplying weaker states with the lethal instruments to constitute the second wave, with further states wanting to acquire armed drones on the cheap, parallel to structural adjustments to the MTCR regime potentially facilitating state perceptions of drone export competition. Our analysis has incorporated, on one level, the United States, Israel, China, and Russia as builder-exporter states, and Nigeria as an example of a purchasing state, on another. Other states can be incorporated into assessments of drone proliferation; not all drone exporters are the same. Some are users and exporters while other are merely exporters, like China. Turkey, Iran, and now Russia, as a nascent proliferator, can inhabit subsequent examinations for their role in global armed drone proliferation."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/06/digital-trade-as-a-global-south-challenge/,Digital Trade as a Global South Challenge,Marco Cepik,Jul 6 2021,"In December 2020, in the Joint Statement Initiative on E-commerce (JSI), the World Trade Organization (WTO) reiterated the importance of multilateral development of digital commerce rules. Despite the reduction in international trade (estimated at -4.85% in total and -9.2% in goods trade), compared to pre-pandemic levels in 2019, digital commerce has been one of the answers to boost economic resilience and recovery (WTO, 2020a). There are three main challenges for assessing digital commerce’s global contribution to the economic restoration and equitable social development.The first challenge is conceptual. According to the Handbook on Measuring Digital Trade, a comprehensive definition of ‘digital commerce’ considers all digitally ordered and digitally delivered (OECD, WTO, and IMF, 2020). International trade that is digitally ordered corresponds to the OECD definition for e-commerce, that is, “the purchase and sale of goods or services conducted on computer networks using methods specifically developed for this purpose.” As such, the service or product delivery may be physical or digital. In turn, the digitally delivered commerce corresponds to ‘transactions delivered remotely in electronic format, using computer networks for this purpose. Although quite broad, the definition excludes international trade conducted by telephone or e-mail.The second challenge, also related to defining, accounting, and measuring digital commerce, is the rapid evolution of digitalization as a whole. Something Azmeh et al. (2020) called ‘technological contingency of existing international regimes’ (p. 689). As many have observed, it is increasingly difficult to differentiate the international trade of goods and services. An expanding added value of knowledge (over 50%) in a growing quantity of products (bundling) can be observed in several global value chains (GVC). Internet of Things (IoT) and 3D printing (additive manufacturing) are just two of the emerging technologies reinforcing the bundling trend. Besides, other digital technologies impact the way international commerce is carried out. Technologies like Blockchain (distributed ledgers) for payments and contracts, automation systems for customs clearance, online company registrations, digital certifications, and online tools for logistic chain and delivery tracking are rapidly evolving. That is, in addition to digital commerce making the difference between services and goods more complex, international trade as a whole tends to be ‘digitally enabled,’ properly characterized by global data flow (Lopez and Jouanjean, 2017).The third challenge is how to develop consistent and fair regulation of global digital commerce. Rapid technological developments, the critical context of the pandemic, and the interests of national governments, companies, civil society, and individuals make evident that issues related to digital commerce will be as crucial as they are controversial. Some topics have been on the agenda since the WTO’s General Council adopted the Declaration on Global Electronic Commerce (1998). For instance, the negotiation on uniform parameters for the tariff exemption limit for small packages (de minimis), or the compatibility of the GATT and GATS rules, or the duration and scope of the Moratorium on customs duties on e-commerce.Additional emerging issues are also decisive. The imbrications between Internet governance and global digital commerce, for example, are evident in the current disputes regarding the scope of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), data localization issues, source code transfers, privacy protection, encryption, market access, cultural site content, and the use of digital currencies such as China’s e-RMB (WTO, 2020b). From a Global South perspective, digital trade negotiations encompass opportunities and risks at the national, regional, and global levels. To be sure, most issues and conflicts cut across those heuristic-defined levels. Global South’s concept implies enormous situational diversity and specific social, cultural, economic, and political dynamics. Nevertheless, it also refers to the common formative experience of colonialism, imperialism, and inequality, triggering potentials of solidarity andthe national level, the challenges of e-commerce in the Global South are directly related to development and security. In the United Nations (UN) landmark document Transforming our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (2015), the terms internet and digital appear only once. However, targets and indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) included digital technologies to promote education, women’s empowerment, and sustainable industry. Readiness for digital commerce depends on transport infrastructure and other logistical requirements. Likewise, broadband access for all requires state, business, and community capacity building. China’s experience, combining government policies, social mobilization, and business action (E-commerce Poverty Alleviation Alliance), can hardly be replicated on the same scale (Cheng Li and Ryan McElveen, 2020; Xinhua, 2020-09-22).By way of example, in Indonesia, the digital business Gojek and the Agriculture Ministry helped local farmers to sell online as part of recovery efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic (UNCTAD, 2021). Digital trade also relates to security for the Global South in at least two dimensions. Although 39 African countries have specific legislation against cybercrime, few have adequate resources to prevent, neutralize, and prosecute those who commit attacks(Odonkor, 2020). The viability of digital commerce is also negatively affected by the increasing securitization of cyberspace by the United States in its strategic competition with China.Global South countries and companies need to move forward on agreements that include non-discriminatory provisions, conflict resolution mechanisms, regulatory harmonization, tariff reduction, and joint initiatives to finance digital transformation at the regional level. For example, the Digital Agenda adopted by the Seventh Ministerial Conference on the Information Society in Latin America and the Caribbean (eLAC 2022) seeks to promote a regional digital market among its 39 goals. In 2018, for instance, 60% of Argentine online sellers had customers in Brazil and vice-versa (Suominen, 2018). LAC will need to improve its digital infrastructure, postal and logistics services significantly, and innovative digital payment services to facilitate cross-border digital trade.A lot can be done at a regional level by improving IP protection, data localization, and interoperability of digital platforms. The regional digital dialogue could help to revive the Mercosur integration process in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Another important example comes from the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) framework. In June 2021, 38 countries had ratified the treaty at the African Union (AU), and the 54 signatories planned to conclude negotiations on the e-Commerce chapter by December 2021. As Banga et al. (2021) highlight, negotiations on digital trade can be facilitated because AU already has a Convention on Cyber ​​Security and Personal Data Protection. If the AfCFTA can adopt a single common digital certificate of origin (CoO) system and effective/balanced taxation, this would have significant implications for global negotiations.The Covid-19 pandemic has increased inequalities between countries and social groups. As mentioned, digital trade can help recovery and transformation. Ahead of the 12th WTO Ministerial Meeting, 86 countries (EU-27 plus 59 countries) are negotiating digital rules under a ‘Joint Statement Initiative on E-Commerce.’ India and South Africa lead a group (including the majority of African countries) advocating the end of the 1998 Moratorium on customs duties on e-commerce, as well as a proper multilateral framework to discuss the definition, scope, and levels of digital trade taxation (Kelsey et al., 2020). As countries like the United States and Japan support a permanent moratorium, the digital trade issues are connected with the market concentration and the role of giant tech firms. Nowadays, the US and China account for 90% of the market value of the world’s 70 largest digital platforms, with Africa and Latin America together accounting for onlynavigate current and future tensions between big tech corporations and great powers, the Global South must define common interests and devise better-coordinated actions. Especially regarding digital infrastructure, protocols, security, and inclusion. Digitally enabled trade is part and parcel of the future global economy and security. The global IR community should pay close attention to its conflicts and potentialities. "
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/06/opinion-the-gendered-face-of-violence-and-erasure-in-kashmir/,Opinion – The Gendered Face of Violence and Erasure in Kashmir,Samreen Mushtaq,Jul 6 2021,"On 1 July 2021, there were reports about the deployment of women soldiers from the Assam Rifles (one of the paramilitary forces) to conduct security operations and assist Indian troops in Kashmir in “maintaining peace in the Valley.” While they were previously engaged in some areas of Kashmir in 2020 to keep a check on “drug smuggling,” they have now been authorised to assist the Indian state with its counter-insurgency (COIN) operations. The Indian Army maintained that the women personnel were a force multiplier and when deployed at checkpoints, they would help “bridge the gap” between the locals and the armed forces. A day later, photographs emerged of women in combat gear with guns in their hands, standing guard, frisking Kashmiri women and other regular deployments.Elsewhere, women’s “right to fight” and seeking representation and participation in all aspects of civic life (including the military) is debated in terms of parity and if it substantially addresses the question of gender equality. In Kashmir, however, the question needs to be interrogated in the context of the military occupation. Kashmir is the world’s highest militarised zone with 700,000 Indian military personnel stationed to control the disputed territory. Human rights groups have documented widespread forms of human rights violations including killings, torture, sexual violence, enforced disappearances, mass and unmarked graves, mass blinding committed by Indian soldiers with due impunity in Kashmir. In such a scenario, the role that these riflewomen play becomes one of appearance, where the attempt is to legitimise intensive militarisation with a benevolent face that women are stereotypically seen to represent. This gender code and its discursive effects bring to the fore the notion of bridging the gap as one of erasure of violence; a subtle acknowledgement of there being an issue, and yet a forceful integration of a violent military apparatus with an environment that is hostile to it.When these combat women frisk Kashmiri women, the photographs that emerge speak a story not only of control but also sexualised depictions where these “courageous” women upholding the honour of the nation are presented as inspirations to produce the right kind of female subjectivity for the nation. Their position is constructed in opposition to the otherised – dangerous Kashmiri women radicalised by Muslim Kashmiri men, potential threats to the idea of India and, and therefore, needing to be put in place. This military-sexual complex, then, helps build a narrative of desire in the Indian psyche with regard to recruitment and motivation for women personnel to join the Indian military to protect the security and integrity of the nation.This also gets framed as gender equality through women’s presence in the institution of the military and is simultaneously seen as transforming the military to be inclusive of caring and nurturing practices in a zone of combat. This shifts the military narrative from one centered on violence to a “softened” one that understands local culture, familial and community ties. It is, therefore, set out to perfect the counter-insurgency doctrine of winning hearts and minds. This dimension of COIN, that is at least superficially less violent and more inclined to community-building and assimilation with a humanitarian touch, is perceived as a feminine aim, but one that can help counter-insurgency goals where understanding the gender dimensions is a crucial component to winning a war.This can also be thought of in terms of gendered orientalism, that builds on the binaries of irrational and barbaric versus the rational and civilised. The Indian military woman who partakes in a softer version of a masculinised military structure is out to deradicalise, befriend, guide and act saviour of the otherwise oppressed Kashmiri woman. It highlights an apparently benevolent desire where Kashmiri women’s honour is protected by bringing in female personnel to intrude into their personal spaces during Cordon and Search Operations. The very presence of the Indian forces, their intrusive operations, and the violence of colonial encounters is sought to be erased through attempts at construction of “sisterhood” between these women personnel and Kashmiri women where the latter will find a comparatively “safer” environment to be frisked and searched. It is an enforced sisterhood that uses the category of woman as the common denominator to erase crucial difference and strengthen an institution accused of sexual violence and rejection of accusations of rape as recorded rotten stereo sounds. It is a sisterhood that violently marks its presence and boundaries to repress the goals of liberation inthink of the woman soldier stationed at checkpoints in Kashmir as gender liberation condones the ways in which frisking and searching as an asymmetrical intimate encounter is performed in an embodied way to imprint power and dehumanise the Kashmiri body. It seeks to make invisible the violence that is central to the Indian State’s presence in and control over Kashmir. In such a context, liberation is to challenge this sisterhood of erasure, to call for and fight towards the dismantling of such systems and structures of violence and repression. "

Among them were the elaboration of the European Agenda on Migration in May 2015 by the European Commission, which developed a strategy to tackle ‘irregular’ migration into Europe (European Commission 2015a, 2), alongside a specific ‘return’ strategy called the EU Action Plan on Return in September 2015. The Action Plan set out that the ‘return’ of ‘irregular migrants who do not have a right to stay in the EU to their home countries, in full respect of the principle of non-refoulement, is an essential part of EU’s comprehensive efforts to address migration and in particular to reduce irregular migration’ (European Commission 2015b, 2).By the end of 2015, one of the EU’s key priorities in addressing migration – as stipulated in the Agenda and in the Action Plan – was to accelerate the ‘removal’ of ‘irregular’ migrants and ‘failed’ asylum-seekers through readmission agreements with non-EU countries (Carrera and Allsopp 2017, 70, 73). Hence, the EU reinforced and/or edited its existing EU readmission agreements (EURAs) with non-EU countries, and agreed new ones, thus including EURAs among the main tools of the EU’s migration ‘policy-toolbox’ (Zaiotti 2016, 8) focused on the ‘removal’ of ‘illegal’ individuals from EU territory, including ‘rejected’ asylum-seekers (Cassarino 2015, 219; Giuffré 2016, 263; Trauner 2017, 252). Essentially, readmission agreements are policy instruments (Wolff and Trauner 2014, 11) that ‘stipulate the obligation to readmit nationals of the country with which the EU has signed the agreement’ (European Commission 2005, 2).A considerable body of literature has been developed on EURAs, focusing largely on the EU and its institutions (Carrera 2016), the relationships between EU member states and institutions (Trauner 2017), the efficiency of agreements for the EU (Carrera 2016; Carrera and Allsopp 2017; Emiliani 2016; Giuffré 2016), and the increasing numbers of informalized agreements rather than legally binding ones (Carrera 2016; Cassarino 2007, 2017; Trauner and Slominsky 2020). However, the serious consequences for people subjected to these agreements have been largely neglected in the prior research and are rarely analyzed within the EURAs framework – with the exception of studies focusing on their legal implications for deportees’ human rights (Carrera 2016, Giuffré 2020). In contrast, studies focused on the practice of deportation more broadly (i.e., not within the EURAs framework) have investigated the violent implications for those who are deported and what happens post-deportation, demonstrating that deportees live in a permanent state of marginalization and precarity (De Genova 2017, 2018; De Genova and Peutz 2010; Khosravi 2017, 2018; Majidi, 2017; Schuster and Majidi 2013, 2019).Therefore, by combining an analysis of EURAs with a focus on deportation, this chapter discusses the practices of ‘readmission’ and ‘return’ as stipulated in EURAs as de facto deportations by showcasing the implications of this policy for those subjected to it as an example of the EU’s regulatory power on mobility, which subjugates some populations by exposing them to yet another re-displacement through deportation. Theoretically, we employ Gibney’s (2013) conceptualization of deportation as a form of forced migration and related literatures, while empirically, we utilize the 2016 Joint Way Forward Declaration (JWF) between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan as a case study. The JWF is particularly revealing, not least because it was signed when the situation in Afghanistan was deteriorating: between January and August 2016 alone, almost 250,000 Afghans became internally displaced, bringing the total number of internally displaced individuals there to 1.2 million (UNHCR 2016).through a critical analysis of international organizations’ reports, official statements, and academic works, we discuss the JWF’s negotiation and implementation in order to showcase the normalization of deportation as ‘return’ and ‘removal’ and the enforcement of this policy through pressure and conditionalities on the part of the EU. We also demonstrate how, despite acknowledging the worsening situation in Afghanistan and denying the financial conditionality attached to the readmission of Afghans, the EU used discourses of partnership, cooperation, and development to justify and legitimize deportations. We conclude the chapter by arguing that despite this rhetoric, the forcible removal of individuals from Europe to Afghanistan disguises the violent outcomes of such policies for deportees, namely marginalization, abandonment, and for many, another displacement and re-departure. Accordingly, this chapter is divided into three parts. The first part briefly illustrates the theoretical background underpinning our argument, the second part discusses the case study, and the final part concludes.Deportation as Forced Migration: A Gateway to Further Displacement?There is no definition for the term ‘deportation’ in the European Commission – Asylum and Migration Glossary; instead, it is synonymous with ‘removal’ (EU Glossary 2018, 320). In the EU context, ‘removal’ is described as ‘the enforcement of the obligation to return, namely the physical transportation out of the EU Member State’ (EU Glossary 2018, 320) as stipulated in Article 3(5) of Directive 2008/115/EC (Return Directive). It also establishes that:Under EU legislation, removal is a specific form of forced return. While deportation and removal often are understood as synonyms, deportation is not used as a legal term in all EU Member States (only DE, FI, IE and UK define ‘deportation’ in their legislation) and is only applicable as a general concept by the public, sometimes with a negative connotation. Because of this variation, ‘removal’ is the preferred term to use.EU Glossary 2018, 320In contrast, ‘return’ is defined as ‘the movement of a person going from a host country back to a country of origin, country of nationality or habitual residence usually after spending a significant period of time in the host country whether voluntary or forced, assisted or spontaneous’ (EU Glossary 2018, 329).In this context, according to some scholars, deportation is a form of forced migration that ‘has been made fit for the modern liberal State’ (Dunn, quoted in Gibney 2013, 123) as it is legitimate for a sovereign state to deport ‘aliens’ from its territory if they have breached immigration laws (Gibney 2008). Similarly, De Genova (2017, 9) illustrates what the deportation of ‘unwanted’ individuals means to the deporting state: ‘Here today, gone tomorrow. Out of sight, out of mind. Case closed. Thus, at least from the perspective of the deporting state power, deportation appears to be the final act, the proverbial last word’. Yet, it should be highlighted that despite the ‘legitimate’ and legal aspects involved in the expulsion of those considered by a ‘destination state’ as ‘aliens’, the act of removing an individual from a territory ‘is one of the most severe forms of exclusions from a society and community’ (Trauner 2017, 251), particularly since many deportees are ‘returned’ to conflict areas, ‘converting their deportations into de facto acts of refoulement, whereby return may subject them to persecution, extortion, rape, torture, and death’ (De Genova 2018, 254).Due to the legitimization of deportation, in recent decades, this practice has become somewhat normalized (Schuster and Majidi 2019, 90–91) within migration policies in Western states, which regard it as a natural outcome in the state’s instrumentalization process of governing mobility (De Genova and Peutz 2010, 1, 3; Khosravi 2018, 4). Thus, calling deportation ‘return’ naturalizes the process, since people are returned to where they are said to belong (Schuster and Majidi 2019, 92). Consequently, the use of terms like ‘return’ or ‘readmission’ deflect attention away from the act of expulsion and its devastating implications for deportees by implying a one-fits-all approach via the constructed and imagined natural order of going back home (Khosravi 2018, 11; Schuster and Majidi 2019,this language conflates varied going-back-home dynamics wherein some individuals are forcibly expelled (e.g., deported ‘failed’ asylum-seekers and ‘illegal’ migrants), while others freely choose to go back (e.g., the end of a ‘migration cycle’, especially regarding labor) (Cassarino 2015, 220; Khosravi 2018, 11). Yet, since deportation is rarely voluntary (Andrijasevic and Walters 2010, 993; Collyer 2018, 106), to ‘return’ means to be forcibly removed from a ‘destination state’ to a place assumed to be ‘home’. Nevertheless, the place considered ‘home’ by the deporting state might not be home for the deportee; instead, it usually means being sent back into a conflict situation, and therefore a higher risk of further displacement (Khosravi 2018, 12; Schuster and Majidi 2019, 100).Picozza (2017, 235) asserts that consideration of the different trajectories followed by people on the move, regardless of the decisions of the ‘destination state’, is key to understanding the heterogeneity of such trajectories, which defy any linear and static order in migrating from a ‘home’ country to a ‘destination country’. The heterogeneity involved is far more complex and less linear than orthodox approaches to the study of deportation have assumed. Consequently, if we analyze migration as a multidirectional process (Schuster and Majidi 2013, 2019) comprising multiple cycles instead of a pre-determined cycle of emigration-immigration-return (Cassarino 2015, 217), or as a unidirectional movement between departure and arrival, we can see that deportation is not the end of a migration cycle, but a rupture in a complex process that affects and disrupts the lives of both those being deported and those whose lives depend on that emigrant (Collyer 2018, 108; De Genova and Peutz 2010, 2; Khosravi 2018, 2; Schuster and Majidi 2013, 222–223).In this context, we argue that, despite employing a language of ‘return’ and ‘readmission’, deportation is at the heart of EURAs and similar expulsion policy mechanisms, as in practice, they systematize international agreements and similar declarations with third countries to deport third-country nationals (Trauner 2017, 251). In such policies, ‘return merely refers to the act of removing unauthorised migrants and rejected asylum-seekers from European territory. Moreover, it does not take into account migrants’ post-return conditions’ (Cassarino 2015, 219), as the language is carefully politically constructed to legitimize deportation. In this regard, Cassarino (2015, 220) brilliantly argues that ‘as long as no distinction is made [between return and deportation], current “return” policies are not return policies’ – they are deportation policies that forcibly displace individuals. We concur with De Genova’s observation (2018, 255) that:While deportations are plainly debasing and destructive for individual deportees, their loved ones, and their wider communities, the bureaucratic rationality that coldly executes such severely punitive measures as “standard operating procedure,” and the consequently heartless disregard for the veritable cruelty of deportation for those whose lives are thereby derailed, convert a systemic violence into the simple and banal functionality of a presumptively efficient governmental apparatus.Therefore, we understand the act of an individual’s ‘removal’ from a given territory (i.e., their deportation) as a form of forced migration (Gibney 2013) with serious implications for deportees, including re-displacement.The Joint Way Forward DeclarationAt the beginning of 2016, an EU memo was leaked showing that while they acknowledged the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan ‘with record levels of terrorist attacks and civilian casualties’, both the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) also saw this situation as a driving factor for Afghans to migrate to Europe, so they called ‘for a strengthening of interventions to maintain asylum space in the region’ (StateWatch 2016, 3). The memo emphasized that ‘more than 80,000 [Afghans] persons could potentially need to be returned in the near future’ (StateWatch 2016, 2). Similarly, the EU Action Plan on Return prioritized Afghanistan among those countries requiring high-level dialogues on ‘readmission’ (European Commission 2015b,this backdrop, in recent years, different EU member states, including Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Swedenm and the United Kingdom (prior to Brexit), have concluded informal readmission agreements with Afghanistan (StateWatch 2016, 5; Trauner and Slominsky 2020, 13). Authors have argued that, due to the difficulty of conducting negotiations with third countries and the bureaucratic nature of legally binding agreements, informal arrangements such as declarations, bilateral deals, exchanges of letters, and memorandums of understanding are increasingly seen by the EU as alternatives to legally binding readmission agreements (Carrera 2016, 10; Cassarino 2007, 2017; Giuffré 2016, 272; Trauner 2017, 253–254; Trauner and Slominski 2020, 2). These informalized agreements reduce bureaucracy and usually bypass parliamentary scrutiny and debate in both the EU and the non-EU country, raising the risk that fundamental protection mechanisms such as human rights norms might be ignored (Cassarino 2017, 94; Trauner 2017, 256). Yet, importantly, Giuffré (2020, 8–9) recently argued that legally binding agreements and more flexible arrangements should be considered together when analyzing and studying EU ‘readmission’ policies, because despite their (important) legal differences, their aim is the same: to expel ‘unwanted’ third-country individuals from the EU to non-EU countries.By the end of 2016, alongside an international conference in Brussels dedicated to issues related to Afghanistan, the EU and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan signed the JWF Declaration. It aimed to deport ‘refused’ Afghan asylum-seekers and ‘irregular’ Afghan migrants from Europe to Afghanistan over four years (2016–2020) and to deter others from migrating to Europe, in return for the EU maintaining its current aid funding and offering additional financial support to deportees (Afghanistan Analysts 2016; EEAS 2016a; European Commission 2016a). Deportations were to take place through scheduled and non-scheduled flights from different EU member states in coordination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), and there were plans to build a terminal at Kabul airport exclusively to receive deportees (EEAS 2016a, 4).As an informalized agreement, the JWF did not create legal obligations; instead, it ‘pave[d] the way for a structural dialogue and cooperation on migration issues’ between the EU and Afghanistan, and it ‘establish[ed] a rapid, effective, and manageable process for a smooth, dignified, and orderly return of Afghan nationals’ to Afghanistan (EEAS 2016a, 1). However, it did create solid commitments between the two parties, similar to a formal readmission agreement (Trauner and Slominski 2020, 4–5).Negotiations and ReactionsAccording to a report from the Afghanistan Analysts Network (AAN 2016), more than a year passed before the JWF was signed due to internal disagreements on the Afghan side. In contrast to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the Minister for Refugees and Repatriations, Sayed Alemi Balkhi, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Salahuddin Rabbani, did not agree to sign the JWF and suggested that it receive parliamentary scrutiny and voting, which caused internal friction, leaving EU diplomats worried about delays (AAN 2016), as this statement from the European Commission and EEAS shows:The dialogue with Afghan authorities is difficult and uneven. While President Ghani and parts of the Afghan Government are publicly committed to cooperate on readmission, other members of the Government do not appear to facilitate the return of irregular migrants, while attempting to re-negotiate conditions to restrict the acceptance of returneesStateWatch 2016, 4After the impasse in the Afghan parliament, the Afghan Deputy Minister of Refugees and Repatriations, Alema Alema, together with Deputy Head of the EU Delegation to Afghanistan, George Cunningham, ‘quietly signed the Joint Way Forward in a low-key event at the presidential palace on 2 October 2016’ (AAN 2016). The next day, the EU released the following press statement:Yesterday, the European Union and Afghanistan reached an important political arrangement, ‘The EU-Afghanistan Joint Way Forward on Migration issues’, to effectively tackle the challenges in both the European Union and Afghanistan linked to irregular migration. This is the result of a constructive dialogue based on partnership and a willingness to enhance dialogue and bilateral cooperation in this area.EEAS 2016cUpon the announcement, several international and European organizations, including Amnesty International, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), the European Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AEDH), PRO ASYL, Save the Children, Oxfam, and the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), jointly signed a letter to the members of the European Parliament (MEP) stressing their concerns (Relief Web 2016). The letter stressed that the JWF had been signed without proper parliamentary and civil society scrutiny, preventing ‘any form of democratic accountability’; thus, it would instigate ‘major risks of rights violations such as the principle of non-refoulement, protection against collective expulsions and the right to asylum’ (Relief Web 2016, 1). Dimitris Christopoulos, FIDH President, argued that ‘attempts by the EU to leverage its humanitarian and development aid to Afghanistan to secure the readmission of Afghan nationals in their country of origin represents a new low. This dubious deal negotiated behind closed doors opens the door to the deportation of an unlimited number of failed asylum-seekers’ (FIDHsome members of the European Parliament, such as Dutch MEP Judith Sargentini, opposed the Declaration, arguing that the EU was breaking its own laws by sending people back to war zones, including violating the international legal principle of non-refoulement (Sargentini quoted in Schultz 2018). In 2017, the ECRE argued that an asymmetric European priority was placed on the number of Afghans being deported, on the speed of those deportations, and on short-term solutions to the EU’s own perceived ‘crisis, rather than on negotiating a sustainable solution that considers Afghanistan’s interests and needs, the Afghan people’s history of mobility, and their motives for fleeing their homeland in its current situation (ECRE 2017a, 13).The Declaration: Reciprocity, Financial conditionalities, Human Rights, and Safe AreasIn theory, the obligations of the parties involved in readmission agreements and similar arrangements appear equal and reciprocal (Cassarino 2007, 182; Giuffré 2016, 268; Trauner 2017, 253). However, authors have argued that, although each side has its own agenda, the EU often has leverage to offer incentives to non-EU countries, such as development aid, financial packages, visa facilitation, and other so-called benefits to persuade third countries to sign readmission agreements (Cassarino 2007, 183; Giuffré 2016, 268; Trauner 2017, 253; Wolff and Hadj Abdou 2017, 387). For instance, both the Agenda and the Action Plan asserted that the EU should make use of all leverage available to return non-EU citizens residing irregularly in Europe back to their countries of origin, or to the transit countries through which they arrived in the EU (European Commission 2015a, 10; 2015b, 13–14; Trauner 2016, 319).The language utilized throughout the JWF mentions ‘partnership’ and ‘reciprocity’ between the EU and Afghanistan. It stresses that both parties face migration challenges and that to tackle them, ‘solidarity, determination, and collective efforts’ are needed from both sides (EEAS 2016a, 1). It also contends that ‘the return programmes and reintegration assistance are separate from and irrespective of the development assistance aid provided to Afghanistan’ (EEAS 2016a, 6). Nevertheless, reports and interviews with members of the Afghan government revealed concern over the conditions of the EU’s allocation of aid to Afghanistan.To attempt to persuade ministers of Parliament (MPs) to support the Declaration’s signing, the Afghan Minister of Finance, Eklil Hakimi, told the Afghan Parliament that ‘if Afghanistan does not cooperate with EU countries on the refugee crisis, this will negatively impact the amount of aid allocated to Afghanistan’ (AAN 2016). Salahuddin Rabbani, the Afghan Minister for Foreign Affairs, also stated in parliament that ‘European countries told us: you should either receive our aid to Afghan refugees in our countries, or for development projects in Afghanistan; you can choose between these two options. They asserted very clearly that they could not help Afghanistan in both areas’ (AAN 2016).Similarly, at the time of signing of the Declaration, Rasmussen (2016) reported in the Guardian newspaper that ‘the pressure on Afghanistan is part of a broader EU strategy of making aid to poor countries conditional on them accepting deported migrants’. Hence, because Afghanistan is highly dependent on humanitarian and foreign aid (StateWatch 2016, 5), the Afghan government had little choice but to sign (Quie and Hakimi 2018). In an interview in 2018, Hafiz Ahmad Miakhel, a spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Refugees and Repatriations, stated that the Afghan government ‘have 1.6 million refugees back from Pakistan and Iran… We [the Afghan government] have signed the deal [with the EU] and we are cooperating, but we have requested again and again that Europe review its Afghan policies’ (Miakhel, 2018).Yet, despite apparently making the EU’s financial aid allocation dependent on the Afghan government receiving Afghan deportees from Europe, EU officials denied this connection, with the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Vice-President of the European Commission, Federica Mogherini, claiming at the time of the Brussels Conference, ‘There is never, never a link between our development aid and whatever we do with migration’ (EEAS 2016b). Nevertheless, in a leaked memo, the Commission and EEAS statedEU should stress that to reach the objective of the Brussels Conference to raise financial commitments ‘at or near current levels’ it is critical that substantial progress has been made in the negotiations with the Afghan Government on migration by early summer, giving the Member States and other donors the confidence that Afghanistan is a reliable partner able to deliver.StateWatch 2016, 8Although the Declaration references the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (EEAS 2016a, 2), it ‘ignores both the inhumane upheaval and trauma caused by deportation and discredits the imminent danger facing asylum-seekers upon returning to their home country’ (Wakil 2018). The leaked memo detailed that even though conflict was recognized as widespread in Afghanistan, some areas of the country needed to be classified as ‘safe’ so that Afghans could be deported (StateWatch 2016, 3). In legal terms, this ‘safe areas’ prerogative within a non-EU country can be found in Article 8 (1) of Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the Qualification Directive), which states that ‘an applicant is not in need of international protection if in a part of the country of origin there is no well-founded fear of being persecuted or no real risk of suffering serious harm and the applicant can reasonably be expected to stay in that part of the country.’Nonetheless, organizations such as the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA 2018), Oxfam (2018), and Amnesty International (2017a, 2018) have claimed that the EU and its member states made efforts to present parts of Afghanistan as ‘safe’ for Afghans to be deported to through the internal safe area prerogative, thus prioritizing the number of individuals being deported over the actual situation in the country (Relief Web 2016, 1). The policy classified Kabul as safe for Afghans to live in, and consequently to be deported to, despite it being among the least secure cities in the country (EASO 2018, 26–27; Oxfam 2018, 3; Schuster and Majidi 2019, 97–98; van Houte 2017; Trauner and Slominski 2020, 14; Warin and Zhekova 2017, 155).Afghan Deportees: Forced back to displacement, hardship, and re-migrationA year after the Declaration was signed, in a parliamentary question to the European Commission (E-007189/2017), EU parliamentarians asked the age and gender of the deportees, the total amount of money spent on deportations, and who paid for them (European Parliament 2017). The Commission answered as follows: the flights were ‘financed by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (EBCGA)’ with a total cost of €5,479,694.95 (European Parliament 2018b) – just over €15,000 per person. Moreover, the Commission stated that most deportees were male adults, ‘with a small number of females (11) and minors (6), who have been returned as part of a family. The Commission and the EBCGA do not have information on the exact age of the returnees’ (European Parliament 2018b).These answers illustrate the concerns of Amnesty International (2017a, 2017b), the ECRE (2017a), and other international organizations regarding deportations from the EU to Afghanistan: despite the volatile situation in Afghanistan and the expense involved, there is an urgency on the EU’s part to deport Afghans. Indeed, one year into the JWF, Abdul Ghafoor from the Afghanistan Migrants Advice and Support Organization said in an interview that ‘it does not make any sense to deport people to Afghanistan right now. It is a loss on both sides. The European countries spent a lot of money to return people while people re-migrate again’ (Ghafoor quoted in ECRE 2017b). Similarly, Gerry Simpson from Human Rights Watch stated that although it is not unlawful for a state to deport ‘aliens’ from its territory, in the case of the JWF, ‘it ma[de] no sense to do so if the EU wants to stabilize Afghanistan. By doing this, they are fueling the fames for the situation on the ground and for more Afghans to come [to Europe]’ (Simpson, quoted in Birnbaum and Van den Berghedate, research investigating ‘migrants’ post-deportation lives in Afghanistan remains scarce, and little is known about their long-term experiences (Collyer 2018, 111; Schuster and Majidi 2019, 98). The few available studies and reports indicate that deportation is extremely harmful, especially to deportees’ mental health and chances of reintegration into Afghan society, leading many to re-displacement or re-migration (Carrera and Allsopp 2017; Erdal and Oeppen 2017; Khosravi 2017, 2018; Kumar 2018; Majidi 2017; Schuster and Majidi 2013, 2019; van Houte 2017; van Houte et al. 2014).These post-deportation challenges include stigma for different reasons, such as their ‘failed’ migration to Europe, lack of money to repay debts, belonging to an ethnic minority, Western ‘contamination’ (i.e., in the ways they speak, behave, and dress), and suspicions from local governments (Schuster and Majidi 2013, 230–231). These factors and the situation in Afghanistan mean that for many deportees, deportation is not the end of their migration journey, and they are likely to flee the country again (Kumar 2018; van Houte 2017). Moreover, many Afghans who migrate to Europe have never been to Afghanistan before; they are second or third generation undocumented Afghans born in Iran or Pakistan. Hence, when deported to Afghanistan, they are again displaced, having nowhere to go and no one with which to be reunited (Carrera and Allsopp 2017, 77; ECRE 2017b; Khosravi 2018, 2).Khosravi (2017, 3) contends that although for the purposes of Afghanistan’s commitment with the EU, deportees are considered Afghan nationals if they have lived their whole lives in either Iran or Pakistan, but upon arrival in Afghanistan they are denied Afghan national ID cards, which makes integration into society all but impossible. They eventually become ‘denizens’: ‘The condition of social abandonment is experienced by being regarded as both “failed citizen” and “failed migrant” before and after deportation. Deportees in their country of citizenship are turned into denizens with limited access to their citizenship rights’ (Khosravi 2018, 4). Consequently, such people are not only displaced again, with no connections to loved ones, but have no possibility of integration into society.Those who do have relatives in Afghanistan face difficulties travelling to their hometowns due to widespread conflict, adding to their risk of being internally displaced (ECRE 2017b; Norwegian Refugee Council 2018, 10). For instance, the main road from Kabul leading to Hazarajat, in central Afghanistan, is called the ‘Death Road’ due to the dangers individuals face on it, leading some Afghans to stay in Kabul rather than doing crossing this road, at the cost of becoming internally displaced (Khosravi 2017, 2).With the above in mind, we argue that by deporting individuals back to Afghanistan, a country experiencing widespread conflict and which has a deteriorating outlook, the EU becomes complicit in the forced displacement of Afghans in that country, so the urgency with which deportations are taking place should be scrutinized. Moreover, the EU claims that it is committed to the development and stability of Afghanistan (European Commission 2016), but studies (Khosravi 2017; Schuster and Majidi 2019; van Houte 2017) show that as the vast majority of deportees do not reintegrate into society but become internally displaced or decide to leave the country again. The more deportees that are sent back to Afghanistan, the more unsustainable the situation might become, both for deportees without support there, and also for the Afghan state.Finally, by December 2019, the number of internally displaced persons in Afghanistan reached 4,191,000, of which 1,198,000 were displaced by natural disasters and 2,993,000 by conflict (Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre 2020). Thus, ‘return’ to Afghanistan does little for Afghan deportees, as Khosravi (2017, 2) brilliantly argues: ‘opposite to what European states attempt to show, the [Afghan] deportees do not go back home, but they re-(join) a transnational space of expulsion, oscillating between re-departure and re-deportation’.ConclusionBy utilizing the JWF Declaration as a case study alongside research and reports on Afghan deportees, this chapter has elaborated on the conceptualization of deportation as a form of forced migration (Gibney 2013) to demonstrate that despite using terms such as ‘return’, ‘removal’, and ‘readmission’ combined with the normalization of the practice of deportation, the EU subjugates individuals by enforcing them to another re-displacement through deportation. Hence, the violent outcomes of such policy are disguised, and Afghans’ re-displacement and their ‘return’ to a place some of them have never been before are normalized, like deportation itself."

Within this context of restricted entry, refugees have found it increasingly difficult to obtain asylum, with many states in the global north engaged in an ‘illiberal turn’ in their immigration policy (Cantor 2015, 189–193), electing to impose demarcations between political refugees[1] and economic migrants that have largely served to exclude the vast majority of forced migrants from receiving refugee status, a legal and political phenomenon that some scholars have called the asylum-migration nexus (Castles 2006). Zetter (2007), Landau (2008), and Bakewell (2008) have argued that the label ‘refugee’ itself is worth deconstructing and challenging in part because it disregards the multiple causes that compel people to be unwilling or unable to return to their home countries, which has resulted in scholars and activists urging a reinterpretation of the conditions covered by the term ‘refugee’ (Shacknove 2017), the use of new concepts (Betts 2013, 26–28), and a reckoning with the hegemonic influence of the global north in the development and deployment of migration labels and categories (Chimni 2008).There has been some legal progress in the effort to expand the term ‘refugee’ so that it corresponds with contemporary realities and more expansive sociological and academic definitions. However, this progress is regional and scarcely implemented in practice, as is the case in Latin America, where the 1984 Cartagena Declaration has substantially expanded the definition of refugee beyond the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Despite this region’s discursively progressive approach to forced migration and a recent increase in mass displacement in Venezuela and Central America that has rapidly converted countries that were previously sites of emigration or transit migration into destination countries (Gandini et al. 2019), much of the academic focus continues to center around the global north (Feline Freier 2015; Cantor 2015).Mexico, as one of the few countries that has integrated the Cartagena Declaration into its domestic refugee law – the 2014 Law on Refugees, Complementary Protection and Political Asylum (LRPCAP) – offers an interesting and understudied case that provides insight into contemporary refugee reception beyond the global north. Over the last decade, Mexico has gone from being characterized as a country of emigration and migration in-transit to becoming a country of refuge for thousands of refugees from a wide range of Latin American and extra-continental countries. From 2013 to 2019, Mexico saw an increase of over 5,000 percent in applications for refugee status (COMAR 2019). With a long-standing, though numerically minor tradition of offering asylum to a wide range of refugees throughout the 20th century, Mexico has discursively presented itself as a devoted adherent to the protection of refugees (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2011).However, the recent arrival of large numbers of refugees to Mexico, political pressure from the US, and an inadequate implementation of the LRPCAP have hindered Mexico’s ability to adhere to its discursive alignment with international standards. This chapter explores how Mexico has responded to recent arrivals of refugees after the passage of the LRPCAP, focusing on gaps between law and practice. Using over a year of participant observation and interviews at a refugee resettlement non-governmental organization (NGO) in Mexico City from 2018 through 2019 and an exhaustive review of reports by federal government agencies and local NGOs, we analyze how geopolitical pressure, extraterritorial expansion of US migration control, and the asymmetrical bilateral relationship with the US has conditioned the implementation of Mexico’s refugee policy. We argue that Mexico’s discourse, laws, and regional policies tend to reflect principles of state-state solidarity and a certain degree of solidarity with refugees. However, the implementation of these laws and policies represents a neoliberal model of migration governance that mirrors the global north’s securitization schemes. In this context, translocal NGOs and grassroots groups are responsible for filling the gaps that the Mexican state is unwilling to address, employing transformative practices grounded in mobility, membership, and visibility that offer an alternative approach to the global north’s migration governance frameworks. However, they are limited by the scarce support they receive from the state. Our fieldwork reveals that the lived experiences of refugees reflect not only the influence that the US exercises on Mexico’s southern border, but also its influence on the implementation of Mexico’s own refugeeMigration Flows across Latin America, Regional Responses, and Extraterritorial Migration GovernanceTraditionally characterized for its stable south-north economic and circular migration patterns, Latin America is shifting towards becoming a region of south-south forced migration (Feldmann, Bada, and Schütze 2019). People are fleeing particular parts of the region because of economic instability, corruption, climate change, state violence, and organized crime. However, as Délano Alonso (2020) argues, these root causes are not new. What is new in the region, however, is the multilayered (Miller and Mevin 2017) ‘extra-territorial sprawl’ of US migration control policies (Hiemstra 2017, 45) across Latin America. Within the last 10 years, the US has expanded its migration control policies outside its national borders through a process of extra-territorialization (Fitzgerald 2020), a strategy of deterrence disguised as national security aimed at preventing migrants and refugees from reaching its physical borders through regional ‘collaboration’. Hiemstra (2017, 47–53) argues that the US has been successful in implementing its migration control policies across Latin America through regional ‘partnerships’ with transit countries and the international expansion of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) efforts to combat drug trafficking, organized crime, and ‘irregular migration flows’, thus ‘stretching’ the presence of US military across the region.The US’s exterritorial extension of migration control policies has reshaped how people are moving across the region and where they are ultimately arriving and settling. Militarization and policing across the Central America-US corridor has forced migrants to forge new and dangerous paths en route to the US, putting them at a higher risk for assault, rape, kidnapping, and death (Martinez 2014). As survival strategies for overcoming these risks, asylum seekers and migrants are traveling together in larger groups as a method of survival, protection, and as a political act to visibilize the systemic violence they face in transit (da Silveira Moreira 2013; Rivera Hernandez 2017).While scholarship has vastly examined how destination countries in the global north govern migration flows from the global south (Gibney 2004; Hollifield 2004) and how migrants and refugees experience and navigate migration policies in the global north (De Genova 2002; Mejivar 2006; Abrego 2012), scholars are beginning to analyze the challenges and opportunities that forced migration poses in the global south and unpack what factors, and at which level, shape how states frame and implement domestic refugee legislation. Although Latin America has a long tradition of acting as a region of asylum for political refugees (Gleizer 2011, 18; Grandi 2017, 4), the demographic profile of asylum-seekers in the region has changed, with an increasing number of asylum applications from extra-continental countries as well as from indigenous and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, and queer plus (LGBTQ+) communities (IOM 2019) posing social, linguistic, and legal challenges in countries unaccustomed to these demographic profiles.According to Feline Frier (2015), Latin America is a distinctive region because it has discursively contested restrictive refugee law and policy grounded in national security. Refugee policy in the region has been characterized as leaning towards a ‘liberal paradigm shift’ – through adopting and implementing refugee policies centered on human rights, integration, and protection. Emblematic of this liberal paradigm shift is the development of the Cartagena Declaration of 1984, which arose as a response to mass displacement in Central America stemming from civil wars in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Cartagena expands the definition of ‘refugee’ far beyond the 1951 Geneva Convention definition (Organization of American States 1984).[2] While Fischel (2019) argues that this represents an asylum regime change, Cartagena’s limitations – being non-binding, validating sovereignty, serving largely as a conceptual framework – has meant that it is scarcely applied even by states that have signed it. Still, with the notable exception of the African Union’s similarly expansive definition of refugee (Okello 2014), Cartagena and Latin America stand out globally as translating the humanitarian spirit of the Geneva Convention to contemporary contexts of forcedaddition to the Cartagena Declaration and likely as a result of its coalition building in the region, Latin American countries have adopted programs and initiatives with a focus on human rights to address forced migration regionally and sub-regionally. Among region-wide programs are the 1994 San José Declaration, the 2004 Mexico Plan of Action, and the 2014 Brazil Plan of Action. Among sub-regional collaborations are the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR), which has created a free movement residence agreement between Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil (previously Venezuela as well), and the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which has launched initiatives related to migration through the South American Conference on Migration (Pires Ramos et al. 2017). In Central America and Mexico, the 2017 Comprehensive Regional Framework for Protection and Solutions (MIRPS) and the 2019 Comprehensive Development Plan have taken a human rights-based approach to migration in the region, with collaborative resettlement plans and an emphasis on addressing the root causes of migration. Although there has been little indication as to the success of these last two initiatives, due in part to their relative novelty (Velázquez 2020, 43), in theory they represent a collaborative, transnational approach that contrasts sharply with the unilateralism and national security approach of the US, making these initiatives geopolitically significant.Apart from multilateral collaborations, a number of countries have adopted refugee and migration laws that ostensibly prioritize human rights considerations over national security, with Argentina being the first in the world to recognize migration as a human right in 2003, followed by Colombia in 2004, and Ecuador and Uruguay in 2008 (Gandini et al. 2019). The Cartagena Declaration’s wide framing of the definition of refugee has been adopted in domestic legislation by 15 countries in the region as well, lending a degree of credibility to its relevance (Fischel 2019; Cantor 2015, 196). However, despite the incorporation of the Cartagena Declaration into the domestic legislation of most countries in the region, Mexico remains the only country that has actually applied Cartagena en masse, and to this date it has only been applied to Venezuelans applying for refugee status in Mexico (Gandini et al. 2019). In the following sections, we analyze Mexico as a case study of a country that espouses the human-rights-centered principles enshrined in international and regional frameworks, exploring how the implementation of its refugee law coheres with and deviates from these frameworks under geopolitical pressures and the proliferation of extraterritorial bordering regimes.Mexico’s National Approach to Refugee Protection (2014–2019): Protection, Temporary Legality, and DeportationMexico’s contemporary approach to refugee protection is grounded in three legal frameworks: the Mexican Constitution, the 2011 Law of Migration, and the 2011 Law of Refugees, Complementary Protection and Political Asylum[3]. However, Mexico’s economic integration with the US (Delano 2011, 5), bilateral securitization agreements with the US related to the 2014 surge of unaccompanied Central American children, and the 2018 migrant caravans have pressured Mexico into implementing migration governance schemes grounded in border enforcement, deterrence, and removal, significantly affecting the process for seeking refuge in Mexico.Since the early 2000s Mexico has entered a series of bilateral security agreements with the US on managing organized crime and migration flows across the Central America-US corridor. Through security partnerships, such as Plan Sur (2002) and the Merida Initiative (2008), Mexico has secured funding from the US[4] and has carried out its extraterritorial bordering schemes by implementing a series of law enforcement, militarization, and deportation procedures (Flynn 2002; Torre and Yee 2018) in cooperation with Central America and countries in the Caribbean. In effect, Mexico has become a fortress and a buffer zone for refugees and migrants, curtailing mobility towards thecontinued under former President Peña Nieto’s implementation of the Southern Border Program (SBP) in 2014 after the surge of unaccompanied Central American children at the US-Mexico border. The purpose of SBP was to manage irregular migration flows with the aim of securing Mexico’s southern border while protecting migrants entering Mexico. In practice, the Mexican government mobilized military and police presence in Mexico’s southern border towns, establishing roadblocks and mobile checkpoints throughout highways from southern to east-central Mexico; constructed detention centers; and collaborated with officials from the National Migration Institute (INM) and local police enforcement to carry out raids and arrests (Arriola Vega 2017). As a result, Mexican apprehensions of migrants from Central America increased from 134,000 in 2014 to 173,000 in 2015, surpassing apprehensions by US immigration authorities; that same year, Mexico also carried out more removals at the Mexico-Guatemala border than the US-Mexico border (Selee et al. 2019). Furthermore, according to a 2017 survey conducted by Amnesty International with over 500 respondents including migrants and asylum seekers, 75 percent of individuals apprehended and detained by INM officials were not informed of their legal right to seek asylum in Mexico. In addition, 120 respondents seeking asylum were deported – violating the non-refoulement principle and thus domestic and international law (Amnesty international 2019). These policies have expanded an ‘architecture of repulsion’ (Fitzgerald 2020) in Mexico, mirroring US interests, creating what some have called a ‘vertical border’ (Velázquez 2011; Torre and Yee 2018), and forcing migrants and refugees into more dangerous transit routes, leaving them more exposed to organized crime and harsh geographic and climate conditions (Martinez 2008; Hernández 2019). The human rights stipulations of the SBP were effectively ignored.Paradoxically, at around the same time that the Mexican federal government implemented SBP, Mexico passed the LRPCAP, a transformative document that expanded the role and responsibilities of Mexico in receiving refugees. The law stands out not only for its incorporation of the Cartagena Declaration, but also for its inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) based persecution as a grounds for refugee status, the figure of ‘complementary protection’, which offers a pathway to permanent residence, a relatively rapid time frame for resolving applications for refugee status (45 working days), the obligation of Mexico to facilitate access to rights and social services, and the requirement to collaborate with civil society organizations to combat xenophobia and address the protection needs of refugees and applicants for refugee status (LRPCAP 2014).Aside from the LRPCAP, refugees and applicants for refugee status in Mexico are technically granted all rights accorded to Mexican citizens by the Mexican Constitution and are protected by binding international accords and conventions that Mexico has ratified. Recent policies have allowed for applicants for refugee status to access a civil registration document (CURP), a tax ID document (RFC), and a temporary residency card that can be renewed annually, together providing access to employment, healthcare, and education.It is also important to note that Mexico’s Commission for Assistance to Refugees (COMAR), which is responsible for processing applications for refugee status, is a decentralized humanitarian agency that ostensibly protects the needs of refugees and applicants and works closely with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), unlike the INM, which is largely focused on detention, deportation, and national security. Despite the progress represented by the LRPCAP, recent surges in refugee arrivals in Mexico have put the LRPCAP to test. From 2013 to 2019, applications for refugee status in Mexico have increased by 5,000 percent (Government of Mexico 2019). The increase is particularly sharp following Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2017, as evidenced by Figure 1.Mexico has dealt with the surge in applications for refugee status in conflicting ways, at times defying the rhetoric of the US and at other times acquiescing. Unlike his predecessor Peña Nieto, current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has pledged to approach migration through a human rights, development, and regional framework to address the root causes of migration and transform migration into a choice rather than a necessity (Government of Mexico 2019). López Obrador has also stated that he would provide humanitarian protection to newly arrived migrants.In 2019, the López Obrador administration released a document titled the New Migration Policy of the Mexican Federal Government 2018–2024. The document lists the administrative protocols that will be taken to address migration, including treating migration as a shared regional responsibility, establishing safe, orderly, and regular migration, strengthening migration institutions, the integration of foreign nationals into Mexican society, and fostering sustainable development, citing the 2011 Law of Migration, LRPCAP, and the Global Compact of Migration andresponse to the arrival of Central American caravans in January 2019, the INM implemented the ‘Emergent Program for the Granting of Visitor for Humanitarian Reasons Cards’, or humanitarian visa program. These one-year visas provided both migrants and refugees with temporary mobility across the country, the right to leave and reenter the country, and work authorization – essential for local integration.However, the program ended on 28 January 2019 because, according to then-INM Commissioner Tonatiuh Guillen, the visa program was ‘too successful’ and overwhelmed the infrastructure of INM (Lin 2019) after more than 15,000 Central Americans applied for the humanitarian visa. Although this program was short-lived, it represented an alternative approach to the migration governance framework of the US, one centered on access to rights, mobility, and integration. However, in May 2019, the Trump administration threatened to increase tariffs on imported goods if the López Obrador administration did not reduce migration flows into US’s borders, resulting in the López Obrador administration reneging on its original plans and further militarizing Mexico’s southern border.Gaps between Law and Practice: The Lived Experience of Refugees in MexicoThe lived experiences of refugees in Mexico deviate significantly from the protections the LRPCAP discursively offers, undermining what might have functioned as a counter-example to the illiberal policies of many global north countries, and in many cases replicating those same policies of exclusion against refugees crossing Mexico’s southern border. One of the main sources of this deviation between law and practice is the scant funding appropriated to the COMAR, Mexico’s humanitarian refugee agency. Despite a 5,000-percent increase in applications for refugee status from 2013 to 2019, the COMAR’s budget has not increased anywhere near the same rate, with a 2020 fiscal year budget of just over $2 million, less than half of what was requested, to resolve a record high of refugee status applications (SEGOB 2020). The budget of the INM, which is largely focused on enforcement, is around $70 million; the increase in the INM budget from 2019 to 2020 alone was three and a half times more than the total budget of the COMAR from 2013 to 2019 (Soberanes 2019).The meager budget of the COMAR is most directly experienced by refugees in the form of long application resolution wait times that far exceed the 45-day period outlined in the law, reaching close to two years for a little under half of applicants currently awaiting a resolution (Asylum Access 2020). Because applicants are required to sign in at the COMAR’s office every week in person, these extensions are particularly prohibitive in terms of economic integration. During our fieldwork, many refugees recounted that they had to ask for time off to wait in the long lines at the COMAR to sign in, and in some cases, this limited their ability to get hired or maintain a job. For those who are held in detention centers while they await their application’s resolution, this means weeks and often months living in degrading conditions that violate government human rights standards (Colectivo de Observación 2019), generating, according to representatives at Programa Casa Refugiados, physical and mental health problems that follow detainees long after their release.An analysis of favorable case resolutions also seems to imply that nationality and socioeconomic class may be factors that facilitate the application resolution process for some refugees. A lawyer at the Alaide Foppa legal clinic at the Ibero-American University in Mexico City explained in an interview that since 2016, when Mexico declared a situation of ‘grave violations of human rights’ in Venezuela, the Cartagena provisions in the LRPCAP have been nearly universally applied to Venezuelans, resulting in an acceptance rate of 99 percent (Colectivo de Observación 2019). Because Mexico has not applied the same standard for other countries – such as El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Guatemala, where ‘generalized violence’ and ‘grave violations of human rights’ are arguably just as pervasive – the Cartagena provisions are less accessible, leading to a significantly lower acceptance rate for applicants from Central American countries (SEGOB 2020). It is important to point out that most Venezuelans arrive in Mexico by plane – which implies economic resources and the ability to obtain a visa in Venezuela before leaving – and predominantly have high educational levels (Gandini et al. 2019, 318.) While speculative, this may reflect, as Gandini et al. (2019) have suggested, a historical selectivity based on class and race that favors more socioeconomically advantaged groups (Wollny 1991; Garcíato the lack of a national resettlement program, refugees in Mexico are generally responsible for their own integration process, which disproportionately affects lower-income refugees. In our interviews with representatives from Programa Casa Refugiados and during our fieldwork, the local and federal government were scarcely presented as helpful or even involved in the integration process of refugees. NGO representatives that we interviewed cited a lack of financial resources, virtually no alliances between government institutions and refugee resettlement organizations, and insufficient sensibilization initiatives to combat xenophobia and educate employers about refugees’ rights to work. All interviewees considered the government’s response to be inadequate, and refugees observed and consulted during our fieldwork had little confidence in the government, instead relying on shelters, NGOs, and the monthly $50–200 stipend provided by the UNHCR.For vulnerable groups, including women and members of the LGBTQ+ community, the lack of government support combined with discrimination and violence makes for an even more difficult integration process. Many trans women and other members of the LGBTQ+ community often are obligated to perform sex work as a mode of survival, are unable to stay in most shelters due to discrimination, and also face discrimination within government institutions. Their difficulties integrating into Mexico reflect the violent limits of policies that not only fail to facilitate the integration process, but in many cases complicate it, especially in cases of institutional discrimination.In the absence of state policies supporting refugees, NGOs represent the only source of material, affective, and informational support available to refugees, offering a wide range of services, including information about job openings, legal support, counseling, and social events. Programa Casa Refugiados, a particularly comprehensive organization, holds workshops about jobs, basic information about Mexico City, and legal processes, while also offering individualized case management and collaborations with other NGOs and the academic community to advocate for better refugee policies. Shelters like la 72 in Tabasco along with a number of shelters in Mexico City and border towns in the north of Mexico offer temporary housing, medical attention, and a sense of community. This ‘grassroots’ level support offers a minimum level of access to resources to refugees, but the organizations that provide these resources are generally under-resourced themselves, relying on private organizations, international NGOs, and unpaid volunteers. With an increase in applications for refugee status, these organizations have found themselves particularly strained, not least refugee and migrant shelters, which have had to turn refugees away because of a lack of space (Prensa Libre 2019).Grassroots movements, such as the caravans of 2018 and 2019, have also emerged as a way of visibilizing the plight of refugees crossing through Mexico, collectively pooling resources, demanding fair treatment and appealing to the international community for support and sympathy (Valera et al. 2019). In a more global sense, as Varela argues (2017), these caravans also represent a reclamation of agency by their members, who demand an end to ‘state, market, and patriarchal violence’. Interestingly, these demands are in line with Mexico’s Comprehensive Development Plan mentioned above, which seeks to address the socioeconomic root causes of forced migration. Paradoxically, though, Mexico’s foreign policy appears to be aligned with the demands of the caravans, Mexican authorities in 2018 and 2019 reacted with violence to the arrival of the caravans, detaining, summarily deporting, and tear-gassing its members, many of whom had expressed fears of returning to their home countries (Villegas and Yuhas, 2019; Averbuch and Semple, 2019; Pradilla, 2020).Competing Agendas of Refugee Resettlement: The Neoliberal Model and the Solidarity ModelMexico’s progressive refugee law as well as the goals set forth in the regional compacts and development plans it has spearheaded and participated in contrasts with the reality lived by refugees in Mexico. We identify two models that Mexico has employed in its refugee resettlement strategies – a neoliberal model and a state-state centered solidarity model – which reflect the geopolitical balance that Mexico is tasked with navigating in its relationship with the US.The neoliberal model of ‘migration state policy’ tends to view human rights in economic terms and in effect ‘monetizes cross-border flows’ and ‘commodifies forced displacement’ (Adamson and Tsourapas 2019). In the neoliberal model, the economically productive refugee – self-sufficient, not in need of state resources, able to facilitate their own integration process – has more market value’ (Somers 2008; Adamson and Tsourapas 2019) than refugees who are in need of state protection or require state resources in order to socially and economically integrate into the host society. The neoliberal model of migration policy coincides with neoliberal state policies that seek to reduce the strength of the welfare state by disinvesting in public institutions and restructuring indebted economies through structural adjustment loans (Tobias 2012). The effects of neoliberal globalization have been especially acute in the global south, where state resources are inaccessible to many citizens, let alone refugees. In order to secure funding for refugee resettlement, states in the global south, like Mexico, rely on international organizations such as the UNHCR or funding from wealthier states, the latter of which is often earmarked for security and border enforcement, further eroding local human rights protections.At the international level, solidarity entails processes of state participation and responsibility aimed at stabilizing social and political order (Weber 2007), grounded in national interests to protect sovereignty and the national community. The principle of solidarity at the state-state level in relation to contemporary forced migration privileges state-state relationships that encompass a series of state interventions based on responsibility, burden-sharing, and ‘shared coercion’ (Fitzgerald 2020) aimed at surveilling and curtailing the mobility of refugees. Nevertheless, these state-state oriented solidarity models produce multiple political configurations and implications across space and geographies. Although Mexico has seen a surge in refugee applications, it receives no support from neighboring countries in implementing regional refugee integration and protection programs, but instead has received solidarity from the US in the form enforcement ‘aid’ for further militarizing its borders and deterring mobility to protect the US’s national borders from outsiders that fall outside its parameters of national membership. Mexico’s replication of US border enforcement and coercion practices across its territory and its weak domestic solidarity model towards refugees indicates that Mexico continues to privilege state-state relationships over state-refugee relationships, thus failing to implement its discursively human-rights-based approach to forced migration.As a result of Mexico’s weak solidarity model at the domestic level, NGOs and grassroots collectives are filling gaps that the Mexican government is unwilling to address with regards to resettlement, such as mobile solidarity, which encompasses the protection and well-being of refugees in translocal spaces across the country, including offering refugees access to food and shelter along the Central American-Mexico-US corridor. Another important initiative is accompaniment programs where staff and volunteers accompany refugees to bureaucratic offices such as the INM to apply for identification documents necessary for accessing health, educational, and legal services, which are essential for facilitating the local integration of refugees. Such practices contest Mexico’s state-based regional frameworks centered on securitization, which have had harmful and deadly consequences on the refugee population and represent an alternative approach towards refugee policy and, more broadly, migration governance frameworks because they are grounded in principles of mobility, membership, visibility, and close, empathetic contact with refugees, all of which have been minimized and criminalized by the Mexican state.Although Mexico has adopted a discursively progressive approach to address the influx of Central American and extra-continental refugees through expanding the Geneva Convention of 1951 definition of refugees into its domestic refugee law, Mexico’s day-to-day responses have been significantly shaped by geopolitics and bilateral economic and security agreements with the US. These factors have pushed Mexico to implement a neoliberal model in practice, despite laws and discourses that reflect a refugee solidarity model. The neoliberal model has left refugees in conditions of precarity – limiting legal routes to access refugee status and complicating their integration process.Our case study of Mexico seeks to provoke further debate on how countries across the global south are responding to shifts in migration waves, unpacking which factors, and at what scale, shape their national responses. The case of Mexico reveals how the US supports and imposes a neoliberal model by earmarking much-needed funding for securitization schemes and refusing to financially support the Comprehensive Development Plan, the COMAR, and translocal initiatives premised on notions of refugee solidarity. Mexico, in turn, has increasingly acted in solidarity with the US’s demands, at the expense of solidarity with refugees. In effect, the US has not only exported its southern border, but it has also conditioned Mexico’s refugee policy to the extent that it scarcely reflects the law. As south-south and north-south migration waves continue to proliferate, new migration paradigms are needed to unpack the decisions, approaches, and implementation models that states are using to address these new challenges and opportunities, and how these models are conditioned by the demands of the global north.FiguresFigure 1: Applications for Refugees Status in Mexico 2013–2019.

The investigation has involved charges that include crimes against humanity (murder, imprisonment, torture, persecution, and other inhumane acts) (ICC, 2011).On 8 May 2017, the Prosecutor of the ICC, Fatou Bensouda, told the UNSC that her office was examining the feasibility of opening an investigation into migrant-related crimes in Libya (ICC 2017). Crimes against humanity, as per the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, means any of the following acts when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population with knowledge of the attack: murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer of population, imprisonment, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution, enforced disappearance, the crime of apartheid, and other inhumane acts (ICC 1998).In the context of widespread and systematic crimes committed against migrants in Libya, the European Union (EU) and its member states continue to collaborate with the North African country to stop migration to the EU via the Central Mediterranean. Since 2014, the EU has not had an active search and rescue mission for migrants at sea attempting to flee from Libya (Pillai 2019). Instead, the current policy consists of pushing migrants and refugees back to the North African country by training and funding the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG) to intercept migrants, which end up in detention centers in Libya (Pillai 2019). Scholars Itamar Mann, Violeta Moreno-Lax, and Omer Shatz have gone one step further and asked for the role of the EU to be scrutinized (Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018). They state that ‘assisting, training, or funding organs of countries that disregard human rights may trigger international responsibility'(Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018). Moreover, they argue, no aid or assistance should be offered in a context of gross and systematic human rights violations if it can contribute to maintaining the status quo (Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018).So far, the issue of the EU and its member states’ involvement in Libya has been mostly discussed in terms of state responsibility and human rights violations. However, influential observers, and even French President Emmanuel Macron, stated that trafficking in the North African country has become a crime against humanity (Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018). Within this environment, claims demanding an investigation of the EU’s involvement in crimes against migrants in Libya came to fruition with a Communication to the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC in 2019 (Shatz and Branco 2019). Invoking Article 15 of the Rome Statute, relating to the initiation of proprio motu investigation, Omer Shatz and Juan Branco, lawyers and professors at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, also known as Sciences Po, alleged that thousands of deaths and other ‘crimes against humanity’ had been committed as a direct result of EU policy. In their communication, Shatz and Branco discuss several modes of liability that could emerge from the EU’s policies in Libya and the Mediterranean (Shatz and Branco 2019). All the above calls for a need to assess the implications of the EU’s collaboration with Libya, not as an international organization but as an individual agent.The aim of this chapter is to assess if individual criminal responsibility can emerge as a result of border externalization policies in Libya, exclusively for aiding and abetting crimes against humanity against migrants. The first section of the chapter will look into the widespread and systematic crimes that migrants face in Libya and its alleged perpetrators. The second section will analyze the relevant legal aspects of aiding, abetting, and otherwise assisting crimes against humanity. The third section will critically analyze the EU’s policies and collaboration with Libya, keeping in mind the two main elements of criminal responsibility: the mental and material elements. The last section will assess if those policies could trigger the ICC’s jurisdiction and what challenges couldagainst Migrants and Border Externalization PoliciesAs early as in 2011, when the ICC opened its investigation for crimes against humanity in Libya, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) issued an alarm after gathering testimonies of trafficking victims in Libya, which they defined as a ‘torture archipelago’ (UN News 2017).Also in 2011, the Panel of Experts on Libya, together with the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL), reported that from the moment migrants enter Libya, they become subjected to unlawful killings, torture and other ill-treatment, arbitrary detention and unlawful deprivation of liberty, rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence, slavery and forced labor, and extortion and exploitation by armed groups, traffickers, smugglers, private parties, police, the Libyan Coast Guard (LCG), and the Department for Combating Illegal Migration (UNSC 2017).In August 2017, Agnes Callamard, United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions submitted a report regarding unlawful deaths of migrants and refugees (UNGA 2017). One of the violations Callamard addresses is the threat posed to migrants resulting from border externalization policies, which could amount to aiding and assisting in the deprivation of life and the failure to prevent foreseeable deaths or other violations (UNGA 2017, 2). In the same report, Callamard detailed how border externalization policies, including ‘assisting, funding, or training agencies in other countries to arrest, detail, process, rescue, or disembark and return refugees or migrants’ raised serious concerns where the recipient states are alleged to be responsible for serious crimes (UNGA 2017, 10–36). She goes on to remark that, by ‘funding and training agencies that commit those abuses, funding States are potentially aiding and assisting loss of life’ (UNGA 2017, 11–37). One year later, in 2018, Nils Melzer, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment echoed Callamard’s findings and stated that ‘for the most part, these violations follow a programmatic pattern that can be described as systematic’ (UNGA 2017, 16–58)Violeta Moreno-Lax and Mariagiulia Giuffré explain how the EU-Libya cooperation, both at sea and on land, and the Italy-Libya memorandum of understanding (MoU) are examples of those migration containment policies (Moreno-Lax and Giuffre 2017). Moreno-Laz and Giuffré define those policies as forms of ‘contactless control’ which, far away from continental Europe, present new challenges to determine responsibilities (Moreno-Lax and Giuffre 2017). The strategy launched in 2016 by the EU has transferred all effective management to Libyan agents, aiming to elude all possibilities of international legal responsibility (Moreno-Lax and Giuffre 2017).However, in his 2018 report to the UN Human Rights Council, Melzer affirmed that those policies of ‘contactless control’ might trigger the ICC’s jurisdiction (UNGA 2018).Aiding, Abetting, and Otherwise AssistingAiding, abetting, and otherwise assisting is a mode of liability in international criminal law, based on holding an individual criminally responsible for a crime, even if that individual is not directly responsible to having committed the act (Vij 2013). Whilst the Rome Statute does not strictly define aiding and abetting, ad hoc tribunals have unanimously defined an individual liable for aiding and abetting as ‘a person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed, or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation, or execution of a crime’ (United Nations 1993). ‘Aiding’ generally refers to physical assistance, and ‘abetting’ is used to refer to a form of encouragement or persuasion (Vij 2013).The most challenging part of analyzing this mode of individual criminal responsibility is to determine its minimum requirements (Ambos 2013). There seems to be a universal agreement on two main requirements: actus reus and mens rea. Actus reus is the ‘criminal act’ (the physical/material element), while mens rea refers to the ‘criminal intent’ (the ‘mental element’) (Knoops 2014). Regarding the material element, jurisprudence under the International Criminal Court demands that the acts committed by the individual must be specifically directed to assist, encourage, or lend moral support to the commission of the crime (Vij 2013, 159). Most importantly, this support must be ‘substantial’ for the perpetration of the crime (Vij 2013, 35). In order to find the individual liable, the person must have aided or abetted before, during, or after the crime was being committed (Vij 2013, 35). It is important to highlight that the assistance can either be an act or omission, and there are no geographical or temporal limitations to it (Vij 2013,the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Article 16 of the draft articles of the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission (ILC) describes aiding and abetting as the following:A State which aids or assists another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act by the latter is internationally responsible for doing so if (International Law Commission 2001):(a) that State does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and(b) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State.Even if the ILC draft articles are not binding, scholars James C. Hathaway and Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen argue that Article 16 has generated ‘wide support as a matter of state practice and opinio juris‘ (Gammeltoft-Hansen and Hathaway 2014). While there is not exact definition of what an action must amount to for it to fit with the definition of ‘substantial contribution’, case law defines it as a ‘contribution that in fact has an effect on the commission of the crime’ (United Nations 2000). On the other hand, under ICC jurisprudence, there is no mention of a need for ‘substantial’ support for the perpetration of the crime. Subparagraph (c) of Article 25 (3) of the Rome Statute deals with the contribution that must exist for a person to be liable for aiding and abetting, and it defines it as a person that ‘for the purpose of facilitating the commission of such a crime, aids, abets, or otherwise assists in its commission or its attempted commission, including providing the means for its commission’ (ICC, 1998). According to scholar Kai Ambos, the fact that ‘otherwise assisting’ was added as a mode of individual criminal responsibility seems to entail an even lower threshold (Ambos 2013, 14). Still, Ambos concludes, one should consider the substantial effect of the assistance to the crime as an independent constituting element of modes of liability (Ambos 2013, 14).The second requirement to assign liability is the mental element. In case law produced by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the mens rea for aiding and abetting cases has remained ‘knowledge’ (Vij 2013, 158). ‘Knowledge’ has been defined as being aware or having knowledge that the acts or omissions are indeed assisting in the commission of a crime by the direct perpetrator (Vij 2013, 158). Moreover, since mens rea is defined as knowledge, it is not even necessary for the aider and abetter to have the same intent as the main perpetrator (Vij 2013, 158). Generally, the aider-abettor must only be aware of the basic elements of the main perpetrator’s crimes in order to satisfy the mental element (Vij 2013, 159). On the other hand, to be liable under the ICC’s jurisdiction, the individual must act with the intent to facilitate the crime, know, or desire that his conduct will facilitate the commission of the crime (Vij 2013, 159).Ambos explains that the wording in the Rome Statute suggests a threshold that goes beyond the ordinary mens rea requirement (Ambos 2013, 15). In Article 25(3) it says that the aider-abettor must act ‘for the purpose of facilitating the commission of the crime’ (ICC 1998). According to Ambos, the term ‘purpose’ extends beyond the mere definition of knowledge (Ambos 2013, 15). The world ‘facilitating’ though, confirms that substantial assistance is not an essential condition of the main crime (Ambos 2013, 53).EU-Libya Cooperation: Externalizing ResponsibilitiesOn 3 and 11 October 2013, two shipwrecks happened near Lampedusa, Italy, causing the death of 636 people (Tazzioli 2016). A few days after the shipwrecks, Italy launched a military-humanitarian operation called Mare Nostrum, with the main objective of rescuing migrants in distress at sea (Tazzioli 2016). Mare Nostrum managed to save over 150,000 people in one year and prevented 2,000 to 3,000 migrants from disappearing in the Central Mediterranean (Eisinger 2015). Italy then asked the EU to support their efforts and contribute to their life-saving efforts, but most nations refused because they considered Mare Nostrum a pull-factor for illegal immigration (Eisinger 2015). The Italian-led search and rescue mission officially ended in November 2014, when it was replaced by Triton, a joint EU operation coordinated by Frontex, the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Tazzioli 2016). However, Triton changed its focus from rescuing refugees and migrants at sea to being solely about border control and preventing illegal crossings (Tazziolimarked a record of refugees and migrants attempting to reach Europe via the Central Mediterranean route (European Commission 2017). The year 2016 was also a record year for the number of lives lost at sea: over 4,500 people drowned in the attempt to cross (European Commission 2017). Since then, the EU has intensified efforts to prevent migrants and refugees from reaching Europe from Libya (Human Rights Watch 2019). EU institutions and member states have invested millions of euros to improve the capacity of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), to prevent migrants from fleeing Libya by boat and detain them in detention centres (Human Rights Watch 2019).Italy has also taken the lead in providing material assistance and training to the LCG and have passed onto them the responsibility of coordinating rescue operations in order to increase the number of interceptions (Human Rights Watch 2019). However, the Panel of Experts on Libya explained in a report to the UNSC that the LCG has not been notified as part of the security forces under the control of the GNA, and the issue of control is further highlighted by multiple reports of criminal activities involving LCG (UNSC 2017, 41). Migrants have recounted dangerous, life-threatening interceptions by armed men believed to be from the LCG (UNSC 2017). After being brought back to Libyan shores, migrants are often beaten, robbed, and taken to detention centers or private houses and farms, where they are subjected to forced labor, rape, and other sexual violence (UNSC 2017).In January 2017, the European Commission sent a communication to the European Parliament, the European Council and the Council titled ‘Migration on the Central Mediterranean route: Managing flows, saving lives’ (European Commission 2017). In that communication, the Commission set out the main goals to, firstly, ramp up training for the LCG to autonomously conduct search and rescue (including disembarkation) in Libyan waters and, secondly, to strengthen Libya’s southern border (in the Sahara Desert) to hinder irregular movements through Libya and into Europe (Moreno-Lax and Guiffre 2017). The EU had already started a training program for LCG officers, with a focus on the interdiction of migrant boats (Moreno- Lax and Mariagiulia 2017).In parallel, in February 2017, the Italian Prime Minister and the Head of the National Reconciliation Government of the Libya State signed an MoU to inter alia tackle border security and combat the steady rise of smuggling (El Zaidy 2019, 4). Under that framework, Italy’s parliament approved the donation of 12 patrol vessels to the LCG to increase interceptions of migrant boats attempting to reach Europe (El Zaidy 2019, 10). Moreover, the EU trained 237 LCG officers to support Italian efforts (El Zaidy 2019). Danilo Toninelli, Italy’s Transport Minister, stated in 2018 that the support to Libya given by Italy to prevent boats reaching Europe was worth €2.5 million and included the 12 boats and funds for training and maintaining the LCG officers (El Zaidy 2019). The parties to the MoU also agreed on the need to find rapid solutions to the problem of ‘illegal’ migration to Europe, while respecting international human rights treaties (Moreno-Lax and Guiffre, 8). Italy agreed to fund the establishment of ‘reception’ centers in Libya, where migrants and refugees will remain detained until they accept to be voluntarily returned to their home countries (Moreno-Lax and Guiffre, 8). Relying on EU funds, Italy agreed to provide technical and economic support to Libyan agencies in charge of the fight against ‘illegal’ migration, including LCG (Moreno-Lax and Guiffre, 8).The training and assistance provided by the EU and Italy are aimed at enabling Libya to intercept boats of migrants and refugees attempting to reach Europe (Moreno-Lax and Guiffre, 8). Since all those measures were put in place, the amount of people reaching Europe via the Central Mediterranean lessened considerably (El Zaidy 2019, 11). Since then, migrants continue to attempt the crossing from Libya, but they are either intercepted by the LCG or pushed back by Italian or European authorities at sea (El Zaidy 2019). All migrants returned to Libya by the LCG encounter indefinite detention and other inhumane or ill treatment in detention centers (El Zaidy 2019, 15), as described in the introduction of thisReus: The Material ContributionThe EU’s decision to end Mare Nostrum in 2014 led to a gross increase in drownings (Rettman, 2019). Triton covered an area up to 30 nautical miles from the Italian coastline of Lampedusa, leaving around 40 nautical miles of key distress area off the coast of Libya uncovered (Rettman 2019).The first mass drowning occurred in January 2015 and the overall death rate increased by 30 percent in the following years (Rettman 2019).The EU also provides support to the LCG to enable it to intercept migrants and refugees at sea, after which they are taken back to Libya where they face arbitrary detention, inhuman, and degrading conditions and the risk of torture, sexual violence, extortion, and forced labor (Rettman 2019). According to Human Rights Watch, the increase in interceptions by the LCG led to an increase in the number of migrants and refugees detained in Libya (Human Rights Watch 2019). In July 2018, there were between 8,000-10,000 people in official detention centers, up from 5,200 in April 2018 (Human Rights Watch 2019). Despite the chaos and dangerous situation in the North African country, the EU’s objective of returning migrants and refugees to Libya exposed a further 40,000 people to crimes amounting to crimes against humanity between 2016 and 2018 (Human Rights Watch 2019).Mens Rea: The Mental ElementIt is clear that EU agents have knowledge of the crimes to which migrants are exposed in Libya and are equally aware of the fact that those crimes are direct result of their acts and omissions. Concerning actions at sea, an internal report by Frontex in August 2014 warned that the withdrawal of naval assets from the area previously covered by Mare Nostrum would likely result in a higher number of fatalities (Rettman 2019). And still, Triton’s objectives were never adapted to search and rescue. In addition, the humanitarian organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), discussed in 2019 the consequences of European containment and pushback policies in the context of Libya. MSF argued that dismantling search and rescue capacities at sea and sponsoring LCG efforts to intercept migrants at sea and forcibly return them to Libya was resulting in an increase of people’s chances of dying at sea as well as being subjected to trafficking, abduction, detention, and extortion (MSF, 2019).The latest UNSC report from April 2020, clearly supports that statement (UNSC 2020). The Secretary-General states, ‘Libya cannot be considered a place of safety for the disembarkation of refugees and migrants rescued at sea… However, refugees and migrants continued to be disembarked in Libya, mainly after interception by the Libyan coastguard’. The report reads that ‘the continuing systematic and arbitrary detention of refugees and migrants who disembark in Libya is alarming’ (UNSC 2020), and that ‘conditions inside detention centres remain appalling’ (UNSC 2020). UNSMIL has also documented the many ways in which the LCG poses a direct threat to migrants’ lives by inter alia demonstrating reckless behavior, using firearms against migrants on boats and displaying physical violence (UNSMIL and OHCHR 2018). In the report, there are accounts of incidents, involving aggressive behavior against migrants and refugees, which ‘are not isolated’ (UNSMIL and OHCHR 2018).Regarding the awful conditions in detention centers, senior EU officials are aware of the crimes migrants face when detained in Libya. In November 2017, Dimitri Avramopoulos, the EU’s Migration Commissioner, said that ‘we are all conscious of the appalling and degrading conditions in which some migrants are held in Libya’ (Human Rights Watch 2019). According to Human Rights Watch, he and other senior EU officials have repeatedly asserted that the EU wants to improve conditions in Libyan detention centers in recognition of grave and widespread abuses (Human Rights Watch 2019). However, interviews with detainees, detention center staff, Libyan officials, and humanitarian actors revealed that EU efforts to improve conditions and treatment in official detention centers have had a negligible impact (Human Rights Watchthe above reports from UN special rapporteurs, Frontex, and human rights organizations, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) also made clear its position to Italy regarding its policies towards Libya. In the case Hirsi Jamma and Others v. Italy, the Grand Chamber of the ECHR unanimously ruled that Italy’s push back operations intending to return migrants and refugees at sea to Libya amounted to a violation of the prohibition of torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3 of the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) because Italy ‘knew or should have known’ that migrants and refugees would be exposed to treatment in breach of the ECHR in Libya (Euopean Court of Human Rights 2012). On the other hand, that judgement has not deterred EU member states to continue implementing the same practices.ConclusionNils Melzer detailed in his 2018 report that the widespread crimes against humanity committed against migrants in Libya have a causal connection to certain external policies (UNGA 2018, 16). The EU policies in Libya seem to fit that definition. By refusing search and rescue, and funding and training the LCG, EU agents are providing means for the commission of crimes against migrants in Libya. Therefore, criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity can emerge from those actions.The investigation into the situation in Libya by the Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC focused on the crimes against humanity of murder, imprisonment, torture, persecution, and other inhumane acts, allegedly committed by Libyan agents (Mann, Morena-Lax, and Shatz 2018). However, if the ICC intends to investigate crimes against humanity occurring in Libya, it cannot do so without examining the role of the EU and its officials. As Itamar Mann, Violeta Moreno-Lax, and Omer Shatz explain, the ‘decision to also investigate the collusion of European actors would more adequately address the entire situation, its systemic nature and programmed design’ (2018). According to them, any investigation that does not take into consideration the involvement of EU agents will just showcase ‘the consequence rather that the cause of suffering, in a system that traps migrants in a vicious circle of more control, more danger, and more dependence on facilitators to escape life-threatening perils’ (Mann, Morena-Lax, and Shatz 2018). Still today, almost on a weekly basis, we hear of incidents in the Central Mediterranean: European coastguards refusing to respond to distress calls at sea, leaving hundreds of people drifting at sea for several days, or secretly organizing privatized pushback operations to Libya (Migreurop 2020).According to the case law and definitions of aiding and abetting, there is enough evidence to justify the emergence of individual criminal responsibility from the EU’s collaboration with Libya. However, that does not mean that the Prosecutor of the ICC would carry out the investigation. Under the Rome Statute, the ICC would not have jurisdiction to investigate if EU member states decided to investigate domestically. Moreover, the Prosecutor could, under Article 53, decide not to pursue the investigation if there are substantial reasons to believe that it would not serve the interests of justice, even after taking into account the gravity of the crime and interests of victims (ICC 1998). If, on the other hand, the ICC decided to investigate EU officials, a wider scope and evidence would be taken into account, as well as other modes of liability, as described in Shatz and Branco’s communication to the Prosecutor of the ICC (Shatz and Branco2019).Last but not least, as Itamar Mann, Violeta Moreno-Lax, and Omer Shatz state, a finding that ‘European actors were involved in such crimes… would show that militia and trafficking agents are often working at the service (or for the ultimate benefit) of European principals, precisely for the purpose of preventing poor and black populations from access to European sources of wealth’ (Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018). Including EU officials in the investigation would also set a precedent for other cases of ‘contactless control’ or border externalization policies, like those of Australia and the United States (Ferlick, Kysel and Podkul 2016), showing that those policies can be deemed active forms of abuse where the end effect is the same (Mann, Moreno-Lax and Shatz 2018).Ambos, Kai. 2013. ‘Criminal Responsibility, Modes Of’.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/07/02/gendered-border-practices-and-violence-at-the-united-states-mexico-border/,Gendered Border Practices and Violence at the United States-Mexico Border,Mitxy Meneses Gutierrez,Jul 2 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.The Mexico-United States border is the most crossed and busiest frontier in the world, with millions of documented border crossings per year (US Customs and Border Protection 2019). These characteristics, along with the political and economic asymmetries between both countries, make it a region of interest for border and migration studies. The complexity of the assemblages of dynamics compels scholars to adopt different approaches to (re)define and (re)understand this region. The socio-cultural and political intersections, paired with other community practices, have become defining conditions of this ‘line of division’. As a result, the border has been de-territorialized and observed as a symbolic and metaphorical one. These approaches that include transnationalism furthered the understanding of the US-Mexico border, particularly regarding the adjacent communities that are conditioned by border practices and policies. However, the main focus of migration and border scholarship is placed on undocumented border crossers’ practices and narratives. This falls under the traditional notion that vulnerability is mainly linked to illegality in such a context. Even though the ‘title’ of the busiest and most crossed border in the world is based on documented border crossers, their narratives have not been of epistemological interest.In particular, the experiences of transborder women at US ports of entry (POE) between Mexico and the US contribute to the thickening and understanding of this topical border. The unique dynamics of adjacent border communities have made female documented border crossers especially vulnerable with regards to gender violence. This chapter aims to show the prevalence of gender violence at US POEs since the 20th century mainly in the form of sexual violence. For this purpose, a discussion about the critical border approach and transborderism is first provided to set the line of departure. Then, the role of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in mediating border crossing experiences is necessary to show the context of power that border crossers frequently face. In the second part of this chapter, an account of women’s experiences at US POEs will illustrate the violent practices of border law enforcers. In the early 1900s, women’s bodies and imposed sexual identities played an essential role in the establishment of border policies, including the work of border protection and law enforcement agencies.Furthermore, and based on the experiences of female former transborder pupils and students at the POEs of Mexicali, Baja California-Calexico, California, this chapter will discuss the reproduction of such gender violence between the past decades and the present. The information was gathered through in-depth semi-structured and open-ended interviews with a population of 15 transborder women that attended school during the 1990s or later. The visibility of the narratives by female transborder pupils and students contribute to a more complex understanding of this topical border and their aggressive, systemic practices toward women.(De)bordering the US-Mexico ‘line ofUS-Mexico border consists of 3,154 kilometers and was established between the years 1848 and 1854. This politico-administrative division was the aftermath of the Mexican-American War that began in 1846. Through the signing of the Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty and the Treaty of Mesilla, Mexico lost 55 percent of its northern territory (Ganster and Lorey 2016, 31–33). This historical episode is pivotal to understand part of the binational dynamics, including northbound Mexican migration that occupies a significant role in Mexico-US relations. The establishment of the border signified the beginning of new socio-cultural, political, economic, and state dynamics of sovereign insistence and resistance that could provide sense to this sudden dividing line.There is a significant amount of literature concerning different approaches to the border. Such is the case for physical or metaphorical borders underscoring their polysignificance and heterogeneous essence (Balibar 2002, 75–86; Mezzadra and Neilson 2013, 4–7), a more contemporary approach as a state institution to manage and determine the included and excluded (Vila 2000, 1–20), and the purpose they serve for ‘world-configuring’ (Balibar 2002, 79). Departing from a critical border studies (CBS) perspective, the border should be understood through the notion of bordering practices defined as:The activities which have the effect … of constituting, sustaining, or modifying borders. Such practices can be both intentional and unintentional; carried out by state actors and non-state actors, including citizens, private security companies, and others engaged in the conduct of that Chris Rumford has called ‘’borderwork’… emphasize attention to ‘the everyday’ – the processes through which controls over mobility are attempted and enacted – and the effects of those controls in people’s lives in social relations more widelyParker and Vaughan-Williams 2012, 3Bordering practices then make the border intersect with state border policies of control and management. Because of such an interaction, several conditions and dynamics are constructed. Such is the case for transborderism, defined by Norma Iglesias (2011, 43) as ‘the frequency, intensity, directionality, and scale of crossing activities; the type of material and symbolic exchanges; and the social and cultural meanings attached to the interactions’. Transborders, including transborder pupils and students, have a complex and deep understanding of border practices (Iglesias 2018, 43–62) and policies of human mobility management, including border-crossing protocols at POEs. Transborder students and pupils in this chapter, who are Mexican or binational, live on the Mexican side of the border and cross it even twice daily to attend school on the US side. Their high levels of interaction with border policies, practices, and mediators make this population relevant for in-depth analysis and understanding of the US-Mexico border. Unfortunately, this demographic group has been mostly understudied in border and migration scholarship (Castañeda 2020, 2), including the experiences of female transborder students that would contribute to the developing of a gender border approach.Mediating the Border: The Role of CBPThe narratives and experiences of transborder people contribute to the understanding of the border beyond a ‘line of division’. They endure the assemblages of power and state policies crystallized in quotidian dynamics. Transborder populations, including pupils and students, live on the Mexican side, but cross the border often or daily to attend to work or school in the US. In this sense, they have to go through US POEs, where their trustworthiness to access to the US will be granted or denied. Currently, there are 48 POEs along the US-Mexico border (GSA 2018). The POE is also a space of contestation, resistance, oppression, and power asymmetry. It is essential to look at these POEs and their implementation of state policies to fully grasp border-crossing dynamics that are mainly mediated by interactions withinfrastructure of US POEs varies throughout the US-Mexico border stripe. These POEs have different ecologies depending on the city and if crossing by car or foot. Although the process of any type of crossing begins before getting in line to cross the border, the main focus in this chapter is on the gendered practices endured by female transborder students and pupils at the Mexicali, Baja California-Calexico, California POE. In general, land-based POEs have been evolving from symbolic demarcations to the techno-structure in place today (Vukov and Sheller 2013, 233–237). POEs serve different purposes, such as human mobility management rendered by CBP officers. Hence, CBP law enforcers become the primary mediators between border crossers and US state politics. Carl Schmitt defines the sovereign as ‘he who decides on the exception’ (Schmitt 2005, 5). In a Schmittian way, CBP officers are the temporal sovereigns deciding over exception and inclusion of transborder people. Such law enforcement practices crystallize the absorption of documented border crossing and migration into the national security continuum that characterizes contemporary US politics and their War on Terror.CBP was created in 2003 and has since become one of the largest law enforcement organizations in the world, with approximately 60,000 active officers. After the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City in September 2001, the Department of Homeland Security consolidated various law enforcement groups, such as the Border Patrol, Immigration Inspectors, US Customs Service, Agricultural Inspectors, and Texas Rangers, among others. Each year, CBP officers process 390 million people through all their POEs (land, air, and sea), apprehend approximately 416,000 persons at POEs, arrest 8,000 wanted criminals, and identify 320,000 persons of national security concern (US Customs and Border Protection 2019). Based on these statistics, the US government is continuously increasing the number of CBP officers to ‘safeguard the sovereignty’ of the United States from aliens and their inherent dangers. Even though the attack to the Twin Towers happened hundreds of miles away from the US-Mexico border, overall documented border crossers but specially transborder commuters, have suffered the consequences of harsh US migration policies.Racism and racial profiling have historically been a characteristic of US Border Patrol and CBP (Castañeda 2020, 3), which is justified by the existence of a ‘reasonable suspicion’ especially in relation to immigration. In 1974, in the case of the United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, the US Supreme Court (1974, 885) ruled that a ‘characteristic appearance of persons who live in Mexico’ is a valid element for reasonable suspicion. Thus, the court’s decision in the Brignoni-Ponce case made the US Border Patrol an essentially racist law enforcement organization regardless of their comprehensive advertized approach to their work and the border community. This decision is especially critical at the US-Mexico border and for documented border crossers who cross northbound and have ‘Mexican features’.In addition to the already precarious and vulnerable situation of transborder students when transiting the border, gender violence worsens their daily dynamic. Female transborder students endure mainly sexual harassment from Mexicans and CBP agents at the POEs while waiting in line to cross the border. Specifically, female documented border crossers are subjects experiencing assemblages of different types of power and violence, such as political and gender-related practices of oppression. Unfortunately, migration scholarship has been mostly interested in the narratives of undocumented women and their transit.Women and the Construction of the US-Mexico BorderA gender perspective was introduced during the 1980s in migration studies related mostly to undocumented international mobility (Donato et al. 2006, 8–10). This needed approach crystallized the complexity and diversity of experiences in the immigration phenomenon. It is in this sense that the inclusion of the narratives of documented female border crossers is pivotal to the understanding of the border as a space for legal human mobilityand sexuality are essential elements on the construction of identity, along with race and class. This entanglement is particularly crucial in a border context where international crossers are continually negotiating their identity with regards to the state (Medrano 2013, 235). Joane Nagel (2003, 14) coined the term ‘ethnosexual frontiers’, referring to ‘territories that lie at the intersections of racial, ethnic, or national boundaries-erotic locations and exotic destinations that are surveilled and supervised, patrolled and policed, regulated and restricted, but that are constantly penetrated by individuals forging sexual links with ethnic Others across ethnic border’. Nagel’s definition assertively shows the relation between the state and the construction of identities particularly in a border context.Part of the identity of the US-Mexico border and thus of its borderlands was constructed throughout the 20th century. The ‘vice’ and therefore ‘dirty’ element of the Mexican identity appointed by the US government and its policies had its peak in the 1920s. The era of prohibition in the US (1920–1933) contributed to the explosion of ‘vice tourism’ in the Mexican borderlands. Mexican bars and cabarets experienced a boom in international customers. US citizens crossed the border southbound to consume alcohol and adult entertainment (Medrano 2013, 236). In the case of the Mexican border city of Mexicali, Eric Schantz (2009) writes about the importance of the Owl Café and Theatre with regards to the local economy and the binational relations with the US, based on the negotiations of contrasting domestic policies concerning the local reality. At that time, US reformers warned about the dangers of Mexicans and their ‘vice essence’ that represented a direct threat to US moral identity. People from different backgrounds aligned with this conception affecting domestic policies. Law enforcers at the border needed to protect the US population from the ‘contaminated’ Mexican border crossers, especially women, as they comprised the majority of sex workers (Schantz 2004, 9–14). In words of Medrano (2013, 235) in particular, state actors, including law enforcement agencies, immigration inspectors, border patrol agents, and military personnel racialized and sexualized Mexican women’s bodies, emphasizing their ‘dangerous femininity’ and their perceived threat to the body politic’. Mexican women’s bodies and their sexual identity and ‘immorality’ helped shaped border policies as they became victims of gender violence.At US POEs, women have suffered sexual violence historically. One of the most discriminatory, racist, and sexually violent episodes at this border is known as the ‘Bath Riots’. On January 28th, 1917, Carmelita Torres, a 17-year-old border commuter working as a housekeeper in El Paso, Texas, initiated a riot against the delousing practices implemented at the US POE. She refused to undergo the delousing process, which consisted of transiting through different chambers as part of the ‘sanitary process’ established to contain the spread of typhus. US authorities believed the disease was prevalent in Mexican revolutionary groups. The first step of the delousing process was to force children, women, and men to remove their clothes to have their body inspected by customs inspectors. Those who had lice were shaved immediately. Their clothes were steam dried and fumigated in a separate chamber that could cause damage. Border commuters that passed the body inspection were directed to a gas chamber to be fumigated with Zyklon B. Then, their disinfected clothes were returned and granted a pass to the US for only eight days. After this period, documented border crossers needed to undergo the process again. This episode had a profound impact on international events. Dorado (2013) found a German pest science journal called Anzeiger fur Schadlinskundle written by Dr. Gerhard Peters demonstrating the effectiveness of Zyklon-B on killing pests and referring to the delousing chambers at the Texas border. This doctor then became one of the leading suppliers of such a chemical, which was used in Nazi gas chambers. Peters was convicted during the Nuremberg trials but found not guilty of charges (Dorado 2013, 153–173). Dorado (2013, 165) states that ‘the events in Germany did not take place in a historical vacuum. There were important connections between the discourse of eugenics, immigration control, and the racialized politics of public health underlying the disinfection chambers in both parts of the world’.This humiliating process not only crystallized the systemic discrimination of Mexicans in the US, but also reflected gender violence practices by customs and border officers. One of the reasons that made Carmelita Torres refuse to go through the delousing process was the fact that the border officers in charge of the process took pictures of the naked women and posted them on the wall of a local bar in El Paso, Texas. Carmelita and many other women working in El Paso, but living in the Mexican city of Juárez, Chihuahua were victims of sexual harassment (Dorado 2013,discriminatory, sexual harassment practices and gender violence are still present in US CBP practices. CBP agents do not post pictures of Mexican or binational women on the walls of local bars, but rather their harassment is made public through Facebook groups. In 2016, a group of attorneys from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania made public several Facebook posts from local authorities with explicitly violent, sexist, and bigoted content (The Plain View Project 2017). In 2019, a Facebook group of CBP officers called ‘I am 10-15′ was made public. ’10-15’ is an allusion to a code used by CBP officers for ‘aliens in custody’ (Thompson 2019). At least 70 officers were identified, out of which 62 were active law enforcers at that time. The alarming content of such posts included sexually explicit comments attacking immigrant women, especially those of Latin American descent. Later that same year, a second Facebook group of CBP officers of the exact nature was disclosed. CBP authorities only expressed that their investigation was still in process (Sands and Valencia 2019).This systemic gender violence and abuse of power throughout border law enforcement agencies are part of the fabric that transborder students and pupils have to navigate daily. In addition, they experience sexual violence while lining up at POEs on their way to school. It is in this sense that their experiences and narratives of gender violence in such spaces reflect the assemblages of power from both countries crystallizing the Mexican macho culture and sexual harassment by US CBP officers. When this ‘gender violent combo’ is part of one’s daily routine, it is easy for victims to normalize it and not feel as transgressed as they would in a different context. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to generate information with regards to gender violence suffered specifically by documented border crossers at US POEs. The lack of indicators and data, unfortunately, perpetuates the invisibility of their condition.Female Former Transborder Pupils and Students at the Mexicali-Calexico Port of EntryThe word Mexicali is a composition of the words Mexico and California. The name of the city on the other side, el otro lado, is Calexico, which is a composition of the words California and Mexico. The city deal of Mexicali includes a dotted line in the name representing the border with the US. As for the city deal of Calexico, the Mexican flag is included along with the motto, ‘Where California and Mexico Meet’. In a way, the conception of these twin cities, a term regularly given to urban duos (Gildersleeve 1979, 1–5; Kearney and Knopp 1995, 2; Alegría 2012, 148–174) was strongly linked with each other. The historical link between Calexico and Mexicali contributes to the development of border dynamics, such as transborderism.Mexicali has two land POEs in the area, Calexico and Calexico East. The latter was constructed in 1996 (General Services Administration 2010, 1) to help with heavy traffic and crossings to Calexico. With data from 1996 to 2020, the Calexico POE reports a total of 129,056,999 of personal vehicles, 278,482,108 of passenger vehicles and 132,667,217 of pedestrians (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2020). However, during the same period, the number of pedestrian border crossers decreased at the Calexico POE with an average of 5,300,000 per year (US Custom and Border Protection 2020). These numbers reflect the regular crossing dynamics of this border city with a population of just 988,417 (INEGI 2020). The transborder community represents an essential part of this circular border motion, as stated previously.The invisibility of the transborder phenomenon renders a lack of updated statistical information preventing us from having an accurate picture of this dynamic. With numbers from 2015, the Prontuario sobre Movilidad y Migración Internacional: Dimensiones del Fenómeno en México, published by the Mexican government, estimated a total of approximately 124,000 transborder migrants, out of which 43,918 (35.2 percent) were women (Government of Mexico 2015). This publication showed that 36,470 people crossed the border daily to study, and an additional 3,129 crossed to study and work in the US. A total of 39,599 transborder students represent 31.8 percent of all transborder migrants. The Mexican border city of Tijuana, Baja California, holds approximately 37.2 percent of all transborder population, which means a total of 46,337 migrants. Out of which, the female population was of 14,808. The border city of Mexicali has a transborder population of 18,329, and the female population consists of 6,209 migrants. With regard to specifically transborder students and pupils, Tijuana has a population of approximately 9,221 (19.9 percent) and Mexicali has a population of roughly 4,472 (24.4 percent). These numbers show that at least 13,696 transborder students and pupils crossed the border daily to attend school in the US. (CONAPO 2017). However, that number could be potentially higher now as not all transborder pupils and students are open about their daily dynamic. One of the requirements for accessing US public education is their place of residence since the budget for education relies heavily on property taxation (Kenyon 2007, 4). Under this rule, US students living on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border should not have access to US public schools. These students or the parents of the pupils use different mechanisms to meet theanalyzed by city, these students do not represent half of the population commuting daily. However, if interpreted by states, they do represent 44.3 percent of the commuters in the Baja California-California region. In other words, in Mexicali, approximately 4,780 students attended school daily in the US and, in the case of Tijuana, we are referring to about 10,464 students with the same characteristics. In the case of Mexicali, and taking into consideration all levels of education, including postgraduate students, transborder students represented 1.65 percent of all students in Calexico. In the case of Tijuana, they represented the 2.23 percent of all students in San Diego, California (Rocha and Orraca 2018, 109–111). Unfortunately, there is no statistical information disaggregated by gender. The lack of data furthers the invisibility of women’s experiences and their epistemological value to the understanding of the US-Mexico border.As stated previously, the transborder dynamic is a complex process of state policies and socio-cultural intersections. This practice renders a deep understanding of the methods that constitute the US-Mexico border. The day for these students can begin as early as 3 a.m. They need to get ready and prepare to line up at the POE, which could take up to several hours. Even if it seems to be a regular day, anything can happen at the border. They cross the border by car or foot. If driving, they would sleep or have breakfast while waiting in line. If they cross the border by foot, they would mostly do homework or eat something. These are not the only border hacks these students developed but are amongst the most common.Those crossing by foot were more likely to be by themselves, with siblings, or with friends. However, the absence of a parent or adult is typical. This means that those transborder pupils are documented unaccompanied children crossing one of the most policed and surveilled borders in the world. Nevertheless, they are not included in the traditional notion of unaccompanied children as it exclusively focuses on the undocumented population. This indicates that documented unaccompanied children border crossers are not likely to be considered vulnerable. In addition, this is a normalized border dynamic in the US-Mexico region but not well researched or documented. In this context, the absence of a guardian in their binational transit contributes to the struggles and violence endured by female transborder pupils and students.The Mexicali-Calexico POE that was modified in 2020, had a unique ecology. This location was surrounded by shops or stands selling all kind of products, including Mexican indigenous handcrafts. The Hotel del Norte is one of the most iconic buildings in the city and present in most of the stories of documented border crossers. There is also a Chinese Pagoda that reminds passers-by of the immigration history of the city and the close connection with the Chinese population. This POE is in a busy location where the heterogeneous population confluence on their entry or exit to the US. The designated path where the pedestrians line up to cross northbound is also surrounded by shops, currency exchange locales, and pharmacies. This area also attracts homeless people asking for money and peddlers. This border area is considered a dangerous zone by locals based on the amount of violent incidents that occur. This space of concern is part of the daily school trajectory of transborder students and pupils, which is experienced differently depending if people cross by car, by themselves or accompanied, and depending on one’s gender. In general, it is in this area of the POE where female transborder students and pupils experience gender violence.Gender violence in Mexico has been increasing exponentially in the last years. Now, Mexico is experiencing a critical phase of gender violence. In a study published in June 2020 by the Mexican National Institute for Women, the government reported that approximately 66 percent of women age 15 or older had experienced some type of violence in their lifetime (INEGI 2020). Furthermore, 10 women are victims of femicide daily. The Mexican state of Baja California is ranked as one of the most violent states for women, having 81 femicides between January and April 2020 (INMUJERES 2020). In addition to the risk these female pupils and students face when interacting with US CBP officers, they endure sexual harassment waiting in line or transiting the POE while still on the Mexican side. Unfortunately, the male population present in such a space shouts obscenities at these female students. Such conduct is normalized, as there are no repercussions for it and therefore, they are easily and continuously reproduced.Specifically speaking of gender violence in the form of sexual harassment, which includes sexual offenses and comments directed at the body or gender, the National Institute for Statistics, Geography, and Computing (INEGI) reported that in the second semester of 2019, 13.6 percent of women age 18 or older had experienced sexual harassment in their city (INEGI 2020).The former female transborder students and pupils in the Mexicali-Calexico context do have ‘anecdotes’ where they felt uncomfortable either in line or when crossing to the US. Most of them recalled that it was quotidian to be the target of sexual comments by the male population present at the POEs either passing by, lined up, or who were workers from the shops. Such offenses included comments about their bodies and uniforms. It is worth pointing out that these episodes happened when they were aged 13 or older and without parental supervision. Just a few of them said that their parents would accompany them the entire way. Hence, this population is not only vulnerable to the harsh methods of CBP but also because of their gender, as stated previously. When female former transborder pupils or students described the POE, they would commonly portray it as a dangerous place due to overall insecurity and sexual harassment. In contrast, male former transborder students or pupils only mentioned the levels of insecurity in Mexicali that would extend to the POE.Concerning the encounters with CBP officers, one-third of this female population reported that they have felt uncomfortable or offended at least once. They recall being asked if they had a partner, what they do after school, or other types of insinuations. Since dealing with an authority with a historical lack of accountability, none of them filed a complaint. It was normal, and because nothing serious happened after the encounter, they did not feel the need to report. Moreover, they felt that reporting it would only cause them troubles in their daily routine. A myriad of these type of cases by female transborder students goes unnoticed by the authorities and scholarship.Without a doubt, these stories illustrate the pervasiveness of gendered border violence that, regardless the age or nationality, female transborder students and pupils still face today. Their bodily experiences contribute to the analysis of the US-Mexico border mostly seen through the undocumented migration lens, or through the lens of trade. Documented border crossers, especially women, hold a unique perspective of the border and of how their gender shapes transborder dynamics by showing the assemblages of violence they endured daily. Transborder women are not exempt from gender violence at the US-Mexico border; they experience itAggressive gendered border practices and violence have been part of the construction of the US-Mexico border. Women’s bodies and sexual identity shaped border policies that are still in place today. Through a critical border studies perspective, the border is conformed and built through everyday practices, such as transborderism. Female documented border crossers have been experiencing gender violence at POEs as the episode of the ‘Bath Riots’ illustrate. Carmelita Torres was the first transborder woman to rebel against gendered border violence and sexual harassment by border protection law enforcers at the El Paso POE. Today, similar practices by CBP are present on technological and social platforms. Such is the case with Facebook groups where active and former CBP officers post sexist and discriminatory comments towards immigrants. The experiences of female former transborder students or pupils provide a snapshot of the prevalence of gender violence suffered at the Mexicali-Calexico Port of Entry.Until we take into consideration the narratives of documented women crossing the border, we will be unable to fully grasp what constitutes it, its essence, and all the levels of violence suffered by border crossers, especially when conditioned by their gender. These stories need to be further researched and, most importantly, to be told."

The place is a huge warehouse named Bira, in Bihac, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). Bira used to be a refrigerator factory and is now managed by the International Organization of Migration (IOM) as a Temporary Reception Centre (TRC) for asylum seekers. The moment is 23 March 2018, when I first visited it. I was there with a group of activists and researchers and we were interested in understanding the dynamics of pushback and deportation that prevent people traveling on the Western Balkan Route (FRONTEX 2018) to cross the European Union (EU) border between BiH and Croatia.Bira was not the first TRC I visited, but something about it made violence particularly explicit, undeniable and impossible to hide. The first time I entered Bira, an IOM operator gave me gloves and a mask. ‘It is protocol,’ he said, ‘there have been plenty of diseases spreading in the camp and we shall take all the necessary precautions’.I looked around me. Nobody apart from visitors and camp staff was wearing masks or gloves. In a very visible way, those were precautions intended to protect us from them. The construction of an ‘us’ in opposition to a ‘them’ was pretty clear. The color of our skins, the quality of our clothes and the freedom of our bodies inscribed the undeniable acknowledgment of the different positionality that European staff and non-European hosts of the camp occupied in that space.When IOM first arrived in Bihac, in 2016, Bira was set up to accommodate the unexpected deviation of thousands of people aimed at crossing the Western border with Croatia. However, because of the continuous pushbacks on behalf of Croatian police forces, many travelers ended up blocked in Bira for months, some even for a year. As their passage became more permanent, Bira was not re-adapted, but its existence as a camp was normalized. What used to be a storage of refrigerators and machines now looked like a storage of living bodies, forced into a paradoxical space, created to accommodate their temporary passage in the form of imprisonment.As I walked within the building, escorted by IOM staff, I could sense the inevitable violence that act came with the space. In that space, my bodily existence as a white European woman inevitably shielded me from experiencing the camp in the way its hosts were experiencing it. My body performed that violence unconsciously and non-purposely, just for the categories of privilege it displayed.A white woman, whose white body could move freely in and out the camp, in and out the frontier, without being observed, monitored, or subject to suspicion. A European citizen, with papers that legalized her existence.A free individual, with a right to choose how to nourish her body, how to self-determine her identity. As a white European citizen, I entered in Bira performing my rights to freedom, legality, and mobility. However, these rights were not granted to me because of my humanness. On the contrary, they were strictly attached to my Europeaness. ‘Bodies are shaped by histories of colonialism… (they) remembers such histories, even when we forget them’ (Ahmed 2007,after the end of the European colonial enterprise, and miles away from the geographical sites where it took place, my body vividly signaled the physicality of the colonizer as their body vividly signaled the physicality of the colonized. I was standing on European soil, within a United Nations managed facility, 18 kilometers away from the European Union. Symbols and labels inscribed in promises of universal human rights, freedom of mobility, and rights to self-determination. However, on this border, it was clear that those promises applied to some and not to others. They applied to us and not to them.In the past decade, enormous amounts of funding and resources have been destined to securitize the external borders of the EU.Inevitably, the ‘EU/non-EU borders became the favored arena for testing, developing and shaping the policies of fortress Europe’ (Dalakoglou 2016, 183). The walls on the Spanish-Moroccan and Hungarian-Serbian borders, the intensification of police control in Greece, Turkey, and Serbia, and tensions between the Italian government and rescuing non-governmental organizations’ boats in the Mediterranean Sea contributed to turning points of crossing into points of immobility, where thousands of people remain blocked for months, repeatedly attempting to cross and constantly pushed back.As a Balkan nation with a complicated past of conflict, BiH has often been observed as both within and excluded from Europe (Balibar 2012). As the Eastern margin of the EU, its transformation into a new peculiar point of immobilization shows how one part of Europe is transforming another part into an internal post-colony where ‘all the excluded to the project of modernity are gathered and confined’ (2012, 447).Since 2015, the Bosnian-Croatian frontier has turned into a site of struggle over who has a right to enter EU-rope. The struggle results in the systematized and normalized illegalization, immobilization, and racialization of non-European travelers who, stuck on the frontier, are forced to face the reproduction and legitimation of forms of violence, inscribed on their bodies and on their minds as they ‘are watched, channeled, documented, obliged, commanded and pressured’ (Goldberg 2006, 355). Eventually, ‘their presence, if not indeed their very being, is discussed, negotiated, ordered, and recorded’ (Goldberg 2006, 355).This contribution starts from the assumption that violence perpetuated on the margins of the EU cannot be disconnected from European legacies of colonial domination, and that these legacies are echoed by EU border securitization. Conceived after several fieldtrips, this chapter results from a combination of theoretical and empirical engagement with observing violence experienced by travelers stuck on the Bosnian-Croatian frontier in line with European action as a colonial force.In order to understand how a space like Bira came to exist a few kilometers from an EU border, we must take a step back. It only took me a three-hour bus drive to go from Zagreb to Bihac. I fell asleep in the EU and woke up at the Croatian-Bosnian frontier, where they checked my passport and registered my arrival. After twenty more minutes of traveling, I could notice two main differences. Outside, I could no longer hear bells or see the bell towers of Croatian churches. Instead, I could hear the Muezzin coming from the Minarets of Bosnian mosques. Inside, I no longer had connection on my phone, because my roaming was limited to EU territory. As I arrived at Bihac bus station, I caught myself staring at a writing on the wall of a building: ‘Bosnia = graves of the doomed’. I notice that the building was covered in bullet holes.Bihac is the capital of the Una Sana Canton. This area is part of a region called Bosniaka Krajina. In Bosnian language, kraij means end, and the name of the area can be translated as Bosnian Frontier. Since the Ottoman Empire, this was considered the last zone before the West, geographically beginning on the opposite side of Mount Plješivica. Today, the same mountain sets up the institutional border between BiH and Croatia. This zone has a century-long historical legacy as a place of passage, clash, and encounter between peoples, ideologies, and cultures. In this area, Christians and Muslims have coexisted and interacted for centuries (Bergholz 2016). From 1992 to 1995, during the bloody conflict that succeeded the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia, the city of Bihac was under a siege by the Serbian army. Memorial monuments celebrating those who lost their life in the conflict can be found across the area, and many of the locals today suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.the last two years, this frontier has become one of the central waiting zones for people arriving from the Western Balkan Route (Agier 2016). Most travelers come from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, but since the route on the Mediterranean has become less accessible, it is not rare to find people coming from Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco, or even from Sub-Saharan Africa. Most of them travel on foot, and it might take months on the road to arrive here. Today, this border remains one of the hardest to cross.Following a series of EU and bilateral containment agreements that succeeded the 2015 Syrian crisis (Seeberg 2015), this route was one of the last to be securitized in Europe. However, because of the constant pushbacks of the Croatian police forces, the majority of travelers remain stuck here for an indeterminate amount of time, until they are able to collect the resources to cross again. Once they arrive in Bihac, it takes at least 10 days to reach Italy on foot. During the journey, people avoid villages, hide and sleep in the woods, and must carefully ration food and water. However, most of them will be caught on the Croatian or Slovenian borders, and will be pushed back to Bosnia. This situation condemns them to a paradoxical displacement, where they are prisoners and fugitives at the same time; not wanted in that country, with no desire to remain and no possibility to move forward. Border police violence, camping and squatting, and social marginalization are constant reminders to people stuck here that their lives are somehow less worthy than those of their European counterparts.To address the humanitarian situation, IOM set up four camps. Bira and Miral are set up in two former factories and now host single men. Borici and Sedra, respectively, used to be an abandoned student house and an abandoned hotel. Today, they host minors and families. Notwithstanding IOM intervention, as both the arrivals and pushbacks increased, people began to occupy abandoned and bombed buildings or sleep on the streets around town.As soon as they are able, they arm themselves with backpacks and food supplies and hit the road on the mountains to continue their journey. Until that moment, they have no other possibility than to remain where they are. They cannot work and are not included in public life. They sit in groups on the green grass of the shores of the river Una, or on the benches of the city center. Some of them prefer to remain in the camps, as most cafes and shops do not allow them in.And so it begins, the preparation of what travelers call the game. The expression of the game grew to describe the long trekking that would bring travelers from one country to another. The game consists of days and nights walking and sleeping in the woods, exposed to cold temperatures, rain and snow, wild animals, and with the constant risk of being captured and pushed back by border police forces.After days of walking in the woods, most of the people in the game will be caught by the Croatian police and pushed back into Bosnia. Some of them will manage to arrive to Slovenia and will be captured there. Those who make it to Italy and the Schengen Zone can hope to move forward. The rest of them will find themselves at the point where the game started, forced to attempt it again. The game has roles, characters, strategies, enemies, and obstacles. Forced to make many attempts, those who have been in the game often use the term as a metaphor to portray their role on the frontier as actors playing with theirI reached the Bosnian-Croatian frontier, I found myself in a space of suspension, a space that was European without responding to the main narratives I had learned to associate with the idea of Europe. That space did not participate in the unilateral emanation of the universal character that Europe had for centuries imposed out of its borders. It did not participate in the collective amnesia of war, conflict, and darkness that Europe brought on itself. The dark side of Europe was not hidden. On the contrary, signs of a dark past were more visible than ever. This was the Europe not wearing an EU-ropean costume, where violence was visible and legitimate.In his infamous theorization of necropolitics, Achille Mbembe recognizes a number of similarities between colonial and frontier spaces. He observes that both spaces exist as peripheral zones detached from a core. This core is geographically located far away and for as much as the physical presence of the central authority might be enforced through the imposition of similar educational, cultural, and political inputs, the implementing strategies are inevitably less rigid as they overlap with similar forms of local authorities. As a result, both frontiers and colonies are spaces of suspension.They are inhabited by savaged; they are not organized in a state form… their armies do not form a distinct entity and their wars are not wars between regular armies. They do not imply the mobilization of sovereign subjects. They do not establish a distinction between soldiers and civilians or again between enemies and criminals.Mbembe 2003, 35.They are inhabited by savaged; they are not organized in a state form… their armies do not form a distinct entity and their wars are not wars between regular armies. They do not imply the mobilization of sovereign subjects. They do not establish a distinction between soldiers and civilians or again between enemies and criminals (Mbembe 2003, 35).As no one in the core looks this way, on the frontier, violence returns to be a legitimate mean of enforcement. Today, in the Una Sana Canton, local authorities are increasingly making decisions independently of both Sarajevo and European institutions. For example, Kljuc’s local police has orders to stop buses coming from the hinterland before they arrive in Bihac and force travelers to stop their journey. In February 2020, I took a ride on one of these buses. As we stopped in Kljuc, two police officers got on the bus. They walked around the seats rows and started asking documents to certain passengers. Not surprisingly, the passengers selected for the check were those not looking European. Four young boys and two adult men were asked to get off the bus. They kept showing officers a document granting them permission to travel in BiH, which was given them by IOM in Sarajevo. However, there, on the frontier, the legal value of those documents was suspended. A different authority was enforced. Those commanded to stop found themselves in the middle of a country road. From the core in Sarajevo, they had the imperative to move closer to the border. However, they were stopped before they could reach the frontier.Another example of autonomous management of the crisis is the one of a jungle camp. During the summer of 2019, Bihac municipality independently set up an open camp managed by the Red Cross in an area called Vucjak. Travelers were arbitrarily caught in town by the police and deported there. The health and living conditions in the camp were so bad that people forced to live there were calling it the jungle or jungle camp, and several organizations reported it as not conforming to the European Convention of Human Rights (Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights 2019).These examples are useful for beginning to observe the way in which conventional dynamics, rules, laws, prescriptions, and discourses are suspended to make space for a language of constant emergency. On the frontier, the status quo is eventually reorganized around the issue of travelers’ undesirable presence, and new unconventional, violent, and de-humanizing measures become legitimate in the name of security (Ahmed 2007b).It is in this suspension that we find the connection between frontiers and colonies. According to Mezzadra and Nelson (2013, 84), the colonial frontier is imagined precisely as the ‘qualitative distinction between European space and those extra-European spaces which are by definition open to conquest’. As such, it naturally ‘tends to superimpose itself over other divisions (colonists and natives)’ (Mezzadra and Nelson 2013, 243). The colonial frontier is also strictly connected with what Ahmed would call a space oriented towards whiteness (Ahmed 2007a, 158–159), i.e., a zone where ‘non-white bodies become hyper-visible when they do not pass, which means they stand out and stand apart’. In Bihac, the inevitable detachment from European cores blurred the lines between justice, human rights, and security. This is something that highly connects with a series of debates that are today central in critical migrationimmobilization and illegalization of migrants at European frontiers captured the attention of a plurality of activist scholars in the post-colonial tradition. Reflecting on the reproduction of the post-colonial migrant as a neo-colonial subject and criticizing the overarching attention towards the language of a migrant crisis, new studies emerged combining the scholarly and activist effort to challenge classical epistemologies and re-think discourses and practices (Mbembe 2003; Mezzadra and Nelson 2013; Tazzioli 2015; De Genova 2016; Isin 2018).Undoubtedly, the language of the colonial (post-colonial, de-colonial, neo-colonial) has today reached well beyond the historical experience of land conquer and domination on behalf of European imperialist forces (Bhambra 2014). Thanks to intellectual inputs of distinguished scholars, such as Said, Fanon, Du Bois, and Cesaire, arguments are increasingly detached from treating colonialism as a circumscribed historical fact, highlighting how the histories of colonialism result from Europe or the West’s self-proclaimed entitlement to modernity.Following these theoretical inputs, I understand the colonial as relational before historical. In this sense, I believe we can find the colonial within hierarchies among peoples, ideologies, cultures, class, and race (Goldberg 2006; Bhambra 2014). In turn, reading on this relational understanding of the colonial, I dedicate the rest of this chapter to conversations with travelers I met in Bihac. There, my aim is to identify different forms of violence performed on the frontier that can be connected to colonial violence.My first preliminary fieldtrips in Bihac were primarily aimed at observing and exploring the context to assess its potential as a case study for my PhD research. I did not know what I would find, and I did not plan to conduct formal interviews. The material I gathered at the frontier was supposed to form an archive to reflect on positionality and methodology issues. Consequently, most of the data I display here were gathered in informal contexts, as I reached out to people outside the camps or around towns. I presented myself as a researcher and briefly explaining what I was researching. I did not attempt to orientate them towards a particular aspect of their present or past experiences, but I let them decide what they wanted to tell me. However, I could not help but notice that violence was a recurring theme. In turn, I rely on images, description, situations, and conversations to tell a story about colonial violence on the Bosnian-Croatian frontier. The main objective of this approach is to situate my argument within the specific spatiality and temporality of the European frontier without overlooking historical trajectories associated with colonialism, race, and migration.Travelers captured and pushed back on the Croatian border tell very similar stories about the dynamics of capture. Often, police officers beat men, insult woman, confiscate food supplies and money, and break phones. Deported bodies come back from the game covered in scars, bruises, and in some cases more serious injuries.A crucial and dramatic example is Ali, a 30-year-old man from Tunisia. Ali entered the game from the city of Velika Kladuša in the winter of 2018. The Croatian police captured him, beat him, and took his shoes, forcing him to walk back to Bosnia on his bare feet. Ali stayed in Bira for almost a year, with his feet completely necrotized, abandoned in one container where he lived isolated and immobile for seven months, until he died in September 2019. His story is both a story of physical and psychological violence. The trauma that Ali experienced highly affected his mental health. He refused to have his feet amputated, as he could have never been able to try the game again without being able towith the case of Ali, violence is exercised on the body as much as it is on the mind. Many described the preparation for the game as invading their minds, dreams, and daily routines. They spent entire weeks studying routes and passages, and organizing supplies and groups. The trek is always dangerous. Wild animals, unexpected weather conditions, possible food or water shortage, and illnesses are inevitable risks. Yet, some people attempted the game 10, even 20 times. The constant perception of rejection, of risking one’s life for nothing often leads to depression and anger. As a result, in the past year, there have been several suicide attempts. Many of the travelers who experienced pushbacks reported similar images about the way in which such experiences make one want to stop living. I remember a 16-year-old girl who came from Iran. She was traveling with her parents, and they had already attempted the game 15 times. She told me that she was tired of trying, but that they had no other choice, that this was not life, and that it was better to die attempting the game that to live like this. She said, ‘At this point, death is the last thing I am worried about’.Mbembe’s (2003, 24) assertion that frontiers resemble colonial space highly relies on the understanding points of migrants’ passages as death worlds where ‘war and disorder, internal and external figures of the political, stand side by side or alternate with each other’. According to Mbembe (2003), the suspended temporality and interstitial status that travelers experience in these waiting zones prompt the development of latency and expectation, where the present, the being, and the self, fade into a status of constant alienation. The frontier looks like a purgatory, a middle way, a bridge between life and death, where the traveler has no choice but to struggle. A necropolis where bodies are left ‘subjected to conditions of life conferring upon them the status of living dead’ (Mbembe 2003, 32).This also relates to forms of isolation and exclusion that permeate daily life on the frontier. Travelers are rarely called by their names. They are always observed, stop, and monitored as part of the mob, the multitude, or the migrants (Tazzioli 2020). Their body are physically re-oriented to spaces reserved for them, such as camps, TCR, abandoned buildings, or the woods. One day, I met a 16-year-old boy who lived with dozens of other travelers in an abandoned building just a few meters from Bira, on the way out of town. As many have done before him, he showed me the building as if it were his home, gave me a blanket to sit on, and invited me to stay for lunch. After the meal, we decided to go into town where we were supposed to meet another traveler he knew who was just back from the game and agreed to tell me his latest experience of pushback. To get into town, we had to pass in front of Bira. As we walked in front of the TRC, two police officers stopped us. They immediately divided us. One started talking to me, asking me for my ID and the reasons why I was walking with that migrant. I explained myself and showed my university card. Although he seemed to be satisfied with my explanation, he told me that I could not stay there and I had to go back to town. In the meantime, the other police officer took my friend by the arm and commanded him to go back to Bira. We both tried to explain that he was not living in Bira so he could not really go back to a place where he was not allowed to stay. But the officer seemed not to care. That was the dividing line. Within the frontier, that police checkpoint signaled the space designated for my white European body and the one reserved for his non-white and non-European one. The officer kept stressing that he could not move forward because there were too many migrants downtown. Therefore, I was told to go and he was told to stay. Even though there was not a place for him in that facility, he could not move forward. His body was confined to a space where it had no place.In Fanon (1986), to be black in a white world means that one’s bodily extension is diminished. ‘In the white world, the man of color encounters difficulties in the development of his bodily schema. Consciousness of the body is solely a negating activity’ (Fanon 1986, 110). Colonial violence is organized through the racialization of black bodies in a white space. In turn, the same form of subjectivities (Foucault 1972) applies to the field of the Bosnian-Croatian frontier. Although it experienced contamination with several cultures and religions, the Una Sana Canton remains a space of whiteness where black bodies are signaled, unexpected, watched ‘hyper visible when they do not pass’ (Ahmed 2007a, 159). On the frontier, the historical trajectory of the bodies that aim to cross is reconstructed on the lines of whiteness. Here, whiteness is a visual tool that signals the danger of the stranger body (Ahmed 2007b) just by looking at it. At the same time, it participates in the production of other layers of racialization. In conversation with Bihac residents, no one ever told me to be afraid of travelers because they were not white.As noted by Du Bois (cited in Zuckeran 2004, 46), ‘the global color line is not solely a matter of color and physical and racial appearance… [It] cuts across lines of colors of physique and beliefs and status… is a matter of cultural patterns, perverted teaching, and human hate andexpression ‘economic migrant’ is widely used on the frontier to convert racial and class issues into instruments of fear. As a person who is already in a condition of illegality, the traveler is subjectified as someone having nothing to lose and therefore is keener to engage in criminal activities, such as robbing or pickpocketing. The intersection between poverty, desperation, and race remains a fundamental lens to criminalize the traveler. As noted by Ahmed (2004, 132), it ‘is through announcing a crisis in security that new forms of security, border policing, and surveillance become justified’. In her theorization of affective economies, Ahmed (2004) uses the two cases of burglary and asylum as connected matters participating in the discourse on the right to defense. Traveler are subjects one needs to be afraid of precisely because ‘they are not part of the picture, and with their simple presence they are stealing something from the nation’ (Ahmed 2004, 123).This relies to another narrative recognized by Fanon, which identifies the black body in a white space as constantly out of place. They should not stay where they are, and do not have access to liberty. In Black Skin, White Masks, Fanon (1986, 170) argues that, for the colonial subject, ‘it is solely by risking life that freedom is obtained… human reality in-itself-for-itself can be achieved only through conflict’. For the colonial subject, the right to liberty is not something that comes with humanness, but is something that must be earned and conceded by the white master. On the frontier, migrants’ illegalization produces them as subjects who are arbitrarily deprived of liberty. Ballas, Dorling, and Hennig (2017, 28) observe this illegalization as part of a continuum in the criminalization of racialized subjectivities where ‘every act, as long as it is made by a slave, an indigenous person, a colonized subject, or a black person… become a criminal act’. Thus, the stranger who appears on the frontier is not feared for being unknown, but for being a suspect (Ahmed 2004). The non-white traveler who attempts to reach Europe today is illegalized until the moment he/she is able to ask for asylum. During his/her journey, the condition of illegality forces him/her to hide, escape, and select routes that minimize the risk of being captured. His/her inferior status as a colonial subject is somehow re-framed in the form of illegalization.The first thing the colonial learns is to remain in his place and not overstep his limits. Hence the dreams of the colonial subject are muscular dreams, dreams of action, dreams of aggressive vitality… I dream I am jumping, swimming, running, and climbing.Fanon 1961, 22.To be a colonial subject in the colonized world means having limited bodily extension, being checked, and being stopped (Ahmed 2004). On the frontier, immobilization is not just expressed in the impossibility to cross the border, but exists in the normalization of specific customs that eventually forbid people who are temporary on the frontier from entering certain spaces. Violence appears also in the form of segregation. In Bihac, most restaurant and cafes would not let migrants in. Some of them even have signs outside their door saying that migrants are not welcome. There are customs inscribing where migrants can and cannot go. As they are labelled migrants, they are immediately confined to certain ideas, places and imaginations. Wandering around towns, sitting in the camps, trekking in the mountains, hiding, making oneself less visible as possible become new strategies of survival.Borders are constructed and indeed policed in the very feeling that they have already been transgressed: the other has to get too close in order to be recognized as an object of fear and in order for the object to be displaced (Ahmed 2004, 132). Throughout this chapter, I proposed a dialogue between theoretical and empirical engagement to address violence perpetrated at the Bosnian-Croatian frontier as an expression of European colonial force. This should be read as an input – one among many – to challenge, problematize, and question conventional practices of EU bordering as directly connected with the colonial codification of difference between worthy and unworthy peoples. At the same time, it should also prompt discussion concerning the practice of internal EU bordering throughout which a part of Europe, mostly associated with EU member-states, is making another part peripheral, and for this reason expendable."

The peace agreement that brought forth South Sudan’s independence was facilitated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and other countries like the United States, United Kingdom, and Norway. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed between the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir in 2005 made way for a referendum that allowed the Sudanese people to decide if they wanted Sudan to be split in two. The referendum was held in January 2011 where an overwhelming 99 percent of South Sudanese people voted in the favor of independence of the South thus, forming the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 9 2011. South Sudanese independence was celebrated, and many international organizations looked at the event optimistically.This optimism was short-lived, as in December 2013, conflict broke out within factions of the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). This plunged the recently formed country into a civil war that resulted in the death, abuse, and displacement of thousands of people. This chapter looks at the key turning points in the civil war in a bid to understand the internal displacement caused by the conflict, which is the largest forced migration event in recent African history. It uses empirical data to assess the movement of people and the trigger events that might have led to the movement in the three regions of the Equatorian states, Jonglei and Upper Nile.Variables Defining the ConflictEthnicdiversity is an inherent part of South Sudan, and the country comprises more than 60 different ethnic groups. The largest two groups are the Dinka and the Nuer tribes, which have been at the center of the civil war in South Sudan. Traditionally, both of these are rival pastoralist groups, which have competed over grazing land and water for cattle in the past. They, however, came together for the greater good to mount a resistance against (then) north Sudan. Keeping the rivalries aside did not make the problems go away, and the differences eventually surfaced after independence.Differences in the Sudanese People’s Liberation MovementThe country’s first president, Salva Kiir, is from the Dinka tribe, a tribe that comprises around 36 percent of the population. In his Independence Day speech on 9 July 9 2011, he appealed to the people to view their cultural identities as a ‘source of pride and strength, not parochialism and conflict’. Kiir emphasized the fact that the people were South Sudanese first. Kiir also appointed Riek Machar as his vice president. To understand the significance of this appointment, one has to realize that Machar is from the ethnic Nuer tribe, which is the second largest in the country. Machar was not merely a representative of the rival group, but also an important leader who was responsible for leading a brutal massacre in 1991 against Dinka civilians where around 2,000 civilians were killed. It is therefore clear how Kiir’s stand on unity and the inclusion of a strong figure from a rival ethnic group seemed like a generous step towards inclusion.Things turned sour when, in the beginning of 2013, Machar began vocalizing his criticisms of the way the government was being run under Kiir and on how the economy was being handled. Machar also expressed his intentions of contesting the presidency in 2015. This was not well-received by Kiir, and he fired Machar and all 28 of his cabinet members in July 2013.The Civil WarOn 15 December 2013, at a meeting, the conflict broke out between factions of the SPLA, each supporting Kiir and Machar. While who started the fight is still debated, one version of the events dictates that, at the meeting, presidential guards of the Dinka majority on Kiir’s side tried to disarm the Nuer guards on Machar’s side. The conflict escalated dramatically, and the violence spread and resulted in ethnic cleansing in the capital city of Juba. The issue soon evolved from a political conflict to an ethnic face-off. Machar fled the capital city of Juba and the Nuer faction of the SPLA fled with him. President Kiir later stated that the fighting was a coup attempt by Machar and his allies, which Machar denied. In the first week of fighting, 1,000 people were killed and around 100,000 were displaced.After Machar fled, the violence morphed into an ethnic conflict, spreading to other parts of the country, namely the then-Equatorian states, which are the Central, Eastern, and Western states (Juba is in central Equatoria), the Jonglei state, the Unity state, and the Upper Nile state.In 2015, the two warring parties, the SPLA led by Salva Kiir and the SPLA-IO (Sudanese People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition) led by Riek Machar, reached a peace agreement. The peace agreement was facilitated by IGAD and, as part of the agreement, Machar was supposed to return to Juba and resume his post as the vice president. Machar, however, was insecure about his safety in Juba and insisted on bringing his own fighters to Juba with him. In April 2016, the rival forces clashed again, re-igniting the violence, and Machar fled Juba. In this incident, around 300 people were killed and, in the following week, around 26,000 people fled theSeptember 2018, a peace deal was signed between Salva Kiir and Riek Machar, officially ending the civil war. As part of the peace deal, Machar was supposed to return to Juba by May 2019, which was extended by six months as both parties had disagreements regarding the peace deal. The November date for the peace deal was pushed by a further 100 days due to concerns regarding the rebel leader Machar’s security. This series of delays ended when both parties agreed to form a Unity government in February 2020.Evolution from Community Clashes to Identity PoliticsEvents That Drew the Other Ethnic Communities into the ConflictIn October 2015, Kiir issued an order to increase the number of the states from 10 to 28. This move gave the Dinkas a majority in strategic locations and caused angst among the Equatorians and the Shilluk populations. This move was seen as a ploy by the Dinkas to grab land that belonged to the other ethnic communities. After these moves, new groups that were earlier relatively dormant in the fight began to rise up against the government.In September 2016, Lam Akol of the Democratic Change party (the largest opposition party to SPLA) announced a new faction called the National Democratic Movement (NDM) in an attempt to overthrow Kiir. The fighting also spread to the relatively calm Equatoria region, where the SPLA-IO forces had sought shelter, and to the Upper Nile state.Major Outbreaks in Jonglei, Equatoria, and Upper Nile regionsPost-December 2013, the magnitude of the prevalent community clashes increased. The common occurrence of clashes over resources between different tribes occupying and competing for the same natural resources evolved into something more. All empirical and event data used is dated through November 2019.JongleiAs a result, South Sudan witnessed its first major post-independence ethnic clash in January 2012 even before the civil war erupted between the Dinka and the Nuer factions of the governing SPLM. The government of South Sudan and SPLA had conducted disarmament, targeting the Lou Nuer people in particular after the CPA in 2005. This selective disarmament fueled the communal tensions between both tribes and resulted in armed confrontation backed by ethnic hatred. The state of Jonglei in South Sudan witnessed ethnic clashes between the Lou Nuer and the Murle tribes. Because of this, around 600 people were killed in Jonglei, and around 100,000 people from the area fled their homes. The reason for these clashes was primarily resource scarcity. However, the magnitude of this clash was much more intense than what had been witnessed before. The clash in Jonglei was bigger, more pronounced, and was backed by mistrust between major ethnic groups.EquatoriaThe second region in focus is the Equatoria region. Equatoria holds some of the best agricultural land in South Sudan and was known as the country’s breadbasket. Ironically, the escalation of violence in the region has exposed around 6 million people to the risk of starvation.The most focused-on ethnic tensions in South Sudan are those between the Nuer and the Dinka tribes, who form the major participants of the civil war, the former being associated with the SPLA-IO and the latter with SPLA. The people in Equatoria had lived in relative harmony for years before the civil war broke out in 2013. After the SPLA accused Machar of attempting a coup in 2013, Dinka troops were accused of carrying out house-to-house searches in the Nuer suburbs. Researchers from Human Rights Watch documented widespread killing of Nuer men mostly between 15–19 December 2013. This included the mass killing of 200–300 men in the Gudele neighborhood in Juba on 16 December 2013. This led to the targeting of the members of the Dinka tribe in other parts of the country, especially the ones controlled by SPLA-IO. This event is just one of the earliest examples of Dinka-Nuer clashes following the events of Decemberthis outbreak, the region managed to stay out of the conflict until the government army began purging the opposition in 2016. The peace agreement signed between Machar and Kiir sparked violence in this relatively immune region. The peace treaty of 2015 allowed the SPLA-IO to establish bases around the country, which allowed Machar’s side to recruit in Equatoria. The government’s deployment of the Mathiang Anyoor, a Dinka-dominated militia sought to curtail recruitment in the region. The Mathiang Anyoor, however, terrorized the local population and allegedly killed and arrested anyone suspected of having links with the SPLA-IO. They have also been accused of targeting civilians on ethnic lines.Since 2015, there have been targeted killings in the region that has caused many citizens to flee to other parts of the country and south to Uganda. In a recent event on 3 July 2019, more than 100 civilians were killed, and a similar number of girls and women were subjected to sexual violence in the Central Equatorian region after the revitalized peace agreement in June 2019. This surge in violence itself caused more than 56,000 civilians to become displaced within South Sudan. The land in the region moreover is not being used for agriculture due to the inherent instability of the region causing a standstill in economic activity and food production in the region.Upper NileIn December 2015, President Salva Kiir, after a Christmas Eve broadcast, roped another stakeholder into the conflict when he announced that the then-existing 10 states would be divided into 28 new ones. He appointed 28 new governors who promised loyalty to him in exchange for being put in charge of the new states; these people were then sworn in five days later. This move was seen as a major power play by Kiir’s opposition throughout South Sudan.The Shilluk people in the country’s oil-rich Upper Nile state denounced this move. The Shilluk have often viewed their land as their most valuable asset and therefore have chosen to tread politics carefully. The Shilluk never retaliated against the government and therefore did not have a reason to expect such a move. The group’s main fighting force, called the Angwelek army, was also allied with the government. The carving up of the new states, however, was viewed by the Shilluk leaders as a deliberate attempt to carve up the Shilluk homeland. It was seen by the Dinkas as a move to remove the Shilluk community from their historic land. Therefore, the Shilluk community, along with the Angwelek army, switched sides to fight with Machar.Another reason that might have contributed to this switch in loyalty is the presence of the Dinka Padong militia in the region. Dinka Padong were civilians armed at the beginning of the conflict (in 2013) to help protect the oil operations in the region, which the government was reluctant to disarm. The presence of such a strong militia in the Shilluk region further made the community insecure.The Shilluk force was decently supplied with arms that were provided by their former allies, the SPLA. The common people in the region who earlier benefitted from the fragile balance of politics in the region suffered from this change in the power dynamics and, during the fighting between SPLA and SPLA-IO, the allied Upper Nile faction, many Shilluk people were forced to leave their homes. In the aftermath, the chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan claimed that the government was engaging in ‘social engineering’ after around 2,000 people, mostly Dinka, were transported to the abandoned regions.Internally Displaced PopulationThe major brunt of the conflict has been borne by the people of South Sudan. The people barely got time to recover from the struggle for their independence before this conflict broke out. According to a 2018 report, around 400,000 people have lost their lives since December 2013; in addition, 4.5 million people have been displaced.Such conditions have led the people to move in order to look for better opportunities. South Sudan’s refugee crisis is the largest in Africa and the third largest in the world. The internal displacement of the people is a pressing problem and is difficult to assess and monitor, mainly due to the many logistical, social, and psychological disadvantages associated with thein every three people in South Sudan is an internally displaced person. The number of internally displaced people has risen from 76,000 at the onset of the conflict in 2013 to 2 million as of 2019. The major cause of relocation of people has been the ethnic conflict. The major stakeholders in this ethnic conflict are the SPLA, with a Dinka majority, and SPLA-IO, with Nuer majority. Other ethnicities, like the Shilluk and the Equatorian tribes, have also been affected.Ethnic cleansing by the Dinka-dominated government, lack of security due to fighting between the rebels and the SPLA, lack of economic opportunities, and natural disasters have also pushed people to move to other places in search for better living conditions.The conflict left many sections of society vulnerable. Young men and boys were targeted because they were expected to join the struggle. Women and girls were exposed to sexual violence, such as rape and harassment.According to the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview, there are currently 1.36 million internally displaced people in South Sudan. Out of these, 15 percent reside in protection of civilian (PoC) sites, 32 percent in collective centers, 7 percent in informal settlements, and 46 percent in other sites .The United Nations (UN) bases have been a sanctuary for many of the people fleeing violence. The UN recognized its role as a protector, built fences, and set up sentry points to protect its bases. However, these spaces have not escaped the effects of ethnic divides. On several occasions, the UN bases have turned into conflict zones due to the big role that ethnicity plays in the everyday lives of the people. The bases are often divided into Shilluk, Nuer, and Dinka. Despite this, the base residents witness inter-ethnic fights, which are often stopped by UN peacekeepers.The UN bases have also been targeted and on several occasions, and humanitarian workers have been part of the casualties. In one such incident on 17 February 2016 a UN base that housed 47,000 displaced persons was attacked by culprits wearing South Sudan military uniforms. The attackers killed 30 people, injured 120 more, and burned down most of the Shilluk and the Nuer sections of the base by the time UN peacekeepers pushed the attackers out of the camp.The civilian population at the UN bases live under 24-hour armed guard. Some civilians leave the base during the day either to work or farm, but most stay in the camps due to the fear of being attacked. In bases like these, women have taken up the responsibility of stepping out of the bases for economic activities. The justification given is that men are more likely to be murdered by the soldiers than are women. Women of the families in the bases risk being sexually harassed on a daily basis when they step out of the bases, but they prefer this to putting the men in their family at risk.Analyzing the DataData on Internal DisplacementThe following section assesses the yearly humanitarian needs overview data compiled by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA). Examination of the data aims to connect the dots between the empirical data and the events that took place in the region at different moments throughout South Sudan’s history. The data on internal displacement also is affected by the sentiments of the people involved and the way they reacted to it.Ceasefire Violations in these StatesThe Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) was signed first in January 2014 with the aim of deterring ceasefire violations by providing a platform that could hold the involved parties accountable and hence vulnerable to international scrutiny. The IGAD Monitoring and Verification mechanism (MVM) was established to monitor the CoHA. Following is a table listing the ceasefire violations monitored by the MVM, which was renamed to the Ceasefire and Transitional Security Arrangements Monitoring Mechanism (CTSAMM) after the signing of the Agreement of the resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan (CTSAMM) in Augustthe DotsEquatoriaLooking at the Equatoria region, one might notice the sharp ascent of the number of IDPs in the Central, Eastern, and Western Equatorian states. Between 2015 and 2016 (compare reports from 2016 and 2017), the number displaced people in Central Equatoria almost tripled. The numbers in Eastern Equatoria have risen by more than a factor of 37, and those in Western Equatoria have risen by around 30,000. Such numbers can be attributed to events that incited insecurity at a higher magnitude, like the ones that involved a face-off between the center’s forces and rebels, and also to the amount of ceasefire violations reported in Jonglei, which is just north of the Equatoria region. The instability caused by Machar’s return in July 2016 could also have been behind the rise of insecurity within the state itself.JongleiThe state of Jonglei witnessed a gradual drop in the number of IDPs over the years despite the drop in ceasefire violations. This could be puzzling, but if one looks at the magnitude of the ceasefire violations in Jonglei in 2014, that is the year following the outbreak of the civil war. It is clear that the intensity of insecurity in the state has been high. Jonglei also has been a hotspot for communal violence in the past and a major concern for the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) before the civil war broke out.Upper NileThe major strain in the Upper Nile state comes from the fact that it is an oil-rich state. Hence, violence to grab land should not come as a surprise, which could explain the number of ceasefire violations. The steady number of IDPs in the state, however, is puzzling, which is why one has to look at the indigenous community in the region too.The government announced in 2015 that it intended to divide the number of states and then went on and gave the control of those states to governors who were favored by the Dinka community. Such a move raised a lot of insecurity amongst indigenous communities in the region, but at the same time also cemented the resolve of the indigenous communities to protect their historic land. The Shilluk community is one of the prominent communities in the Upper Nile who, despite a lot of friction with the ruling SPLM, decided to stay put. This was mainly because of the fear that, if they left, the community would leave their land unprotected. This presence of strong resistance chips away at any insecurity caused by other factors.Lack of Contextual Considerations in the Peace DealsIn March 2018, nine opposition groups, excluding the SPLA-IO, formed the South Sudan Opposition Alliance (SSOA) to negotiate with the government. Following pressure from the international community, the Sudanese government succeeded in bringing Kiir and SPLA-IO to hold talks in Sudan’s capital, Khartoum. A ceasefire was signed in June 2018, where both parties agreed to form a transitional government for the 36 months leading up to the national elections. Even though the ceasefire was violated hours after it was signed, and objections were raised regarding the extension of the president’s term by three years (passed by a SPLM majority parliament), the SPLA-IO agreed to share power again with Kiir. According to the power-sharing agreement, 332 of the 550 seats in parliament would go to Kiir’s faction, 128 to Machar’s faction, and rest to other groups. Machar would also be one of the five vice presidents. The SSOA faction, however, was dissatisfied with this arrangement due to the skewed power sharing system as depicted in the tablean inconsideration has been evident in the peace processes since the CPA in 2005. An example is the composition of the pre-election national executive appointed to oversee the interim period after the CPA. According to the CPA the representation from South Sudan was as follows—28 percent from the SPLM and 6 percent from ‘other Southern political forces’.What the Future HoldsThe February 2020 peace agreement is a welcome development for South Sudan’s people and the country as a whole. Further, President Kiir’s assurance to ensure the security of the opposition leaders and the reappointment of Machhar as vice president gives hope to an otherwise volatile country. This volatility, however, also warns one to tread carefully so as to not repeat the events of the past. It is therefore wise to keep in mind as the country moves towards a new future the plight and the social divisions caused by rifts between the minority communities. Such a consideration would go a long way in formulating sustainable peace processes.A look at internal migration in South Sudan makes it evident that the situation does not just simply require a CPA—it requires an inclusive one. In a volatile and ethnically diverse community, like that of South Sudan, a strong leader motivated in the wrong way could tip the scales at any moment to restart the violence. It is also clear that, from here on, the peace process has to be sensitive to people’s conditions, and focus should be given to providing people the basic right to work and live peacefully. The aim going forward now should be to improve basic infrastructure, secure economic opportunities, and promote equitable resource sharing.TablesTable 1: A timeline of the events in the region in focus (Equatoria, Jonglei, Upper Nile)Table 2: Internal displacement over the years; Source: Author’s calculations of UNOCHA dataTable 3: Total number of ceasefire violationsTable 4: Percentage of population in power sharing"

This article discusses the innovative non-judicial participatory mechanism devised by multinational mining corporations and the Brazilian state to address access to justice for compensation and reparations by victims of Brazil’s worst environmental disaster. Drawing from extensive fieldwork in Mariana, Brazil I attempt to shine a light on the opacity of the participatory governance model and process at the Renova Foundation (for a more detailed analysis see Maher, 2021). The article concludes that it is simply not enough to have just a seat at the table in contexts of settling human rights abuses. Moreover, participation strategies that come across as a charade can and do prolong the suffering of victims. I finish the article by calling for binding international norms to safeguard the rights of victims affected by corporate irresponsibility.In November 2015, the Fundãotailings dam, owned by Samarco (a joint venture between Anglo-Australian BHP and Brazilian Vale), collapsed in Mariana, Brazil, provoking the worst environmental catastrophe in the nation’s history. The dam collapse took the lives of 19 people and devastated the homes and/or livelihoods of approximately anywhere between 23,000 families and up to 3 million people.Within the vacuum of binding standards or norms for remedy to victims of corporate irresponsibility, Samarco together with the Brazilian state, and importantly without consulting the victims, agreed to create and fully fund an allegedly independent foundation called Renova (meaning Renewal in English) to address the reparations and compensation for victims. Renova defended its legitimacy as being best placed to deliver a more efficient compensation and remediation to victims than more traditional judicial channels.However, this claim turned out to hold little authenticity. The victims from Samarco’s Fundãodam collapse have still not been resettled into their new homes and village over 5.5 years since the disaster. Thousands of victims have also been denied the right of recognition as legitimate victims by the foundation.Overnight Renova Foundation became Brazil’s most financially endowed foundation by tenfold in July 2016. It was established as a multi-stakeholder governed foundation with an intricate governance arrangement. Renova’s governance involves 70 participating entities that include civil society, public authorities, academia and even the victims themselves to ensure fair remedy is applied in a transparent and human rights-compliant manner, ensuring all the while that ‘no party involved has control over the decision’ (Fundação Renova website, 2019). Through its multi-stakeholder governance model Renova claims to work with a participatory and dialogicRenova embraced an aggressive communicational strategy to showcase its investments in reparations and compensations as documented in the hundreds of professionally produced glossy videos on Renova’s website. As such one would rightfully assume that victims would be content with Renova’s approach, yet this was far from the truth as I discovered during three fieldwork visits to Mariana between 2019-20. So, despite this participatory and democratic approach to providing fair and human rights compliant compensation, why has Renova not been effective to date in the eyes of the victims?The key to understanding this conundrum lies in understanding where, and with whom, the decision-making power rests within Renova’s governance structure. Despite its elaborate form of democratic governance only the Board of Governors can make decisions on spending the foundation’s financial resources whereas the other members and bodies can be consulted and therefore listened to and heard. The Board of Governors has always consisted of representatives from both mining corporations. From August 2018 the courts ruled that the Board of Governors should incorporate two representatives from the victims. However, this never materialized due to fears of power asymmetries and symbolic participation of just two victims compared to six representatives from the mining corporations. Consequently, victims have described the participation and dialogue with Renova as charade-like.It is noteworthy that to date Renova has spent over Rs.$ 13bn reais (US $ 2.52bn) in compensation and reparations. Nonetheless, the victims I interviewed exclaimed that they had not seen the benefits of this money. As one victim often told me they are just a ‘commodity’ for Renova to create projects and take kickbacks. Frustratingly, beyond the payment of rent for temporary accommodation and monthly stipends for groceries those most impacted by the dam collapse allegedly have received the least of this spending. This is despite the fact that Renova employs thousands of people directly and indirectly.The most common response to my point about how well Renova documents its reparations approach to victims was with the Brazilian adage of “é só para inglés ver” or “its just for the English to see.” This phrase refers to situations of deceit, falsehood, trickery, inauthenticity or white/greenwash. Interviewees with victims and their defenders drew my attention to how one of Renova’s main areas of spending has always been in communications and marketing of itself.One recurring theme throughout conversations with victims about Renova was its persistent delay or stall (enrolar in Portuguese) tactics in resettling victims from Bento Rodrigues into their new replica village and homes. This can be explained by the foundation’s willingness on the one hand to always dialogue with victims and on the other, its inefficiency in resettling victims into their new homes. This helps us understand why victims sense that the participatory practices of Renova are a mere charade. The result of this has been the festering of frustrations and discontent amongst victims who see Renova as inept and uninterested in remedying their legitimate grievances. Victims contend that these delays have contributed to the epidemic in depression and suicides experienced in Mariana in the past few years.To alleviate the exasperation of delays, Renova offers victims the chances to settle their claims for compensations in an alleged independent mediation centre, which it also funds and operates. In these mediation centres known as Mediated Indemnity Programmes (PIM in Portuguese), victims can walk in and out within a few hours and leave with a cheque for the damages incurred. Victims and their defenders have denounced this practice as unscrupulous due to the alarmingly low amounts of compensation victims have settled for (often for just around US $100-150 according to interviewees). Coming to an agreement at the PIM centres also implicates victims to relinquish any rights to demand further payment or take future legal recourse againstmain defence against accusations of its inefficiencies and incompliance with basic human rights in providing remedy to victims has been to audaciously deflect the blame on the bureaucratic nature of its multistakeholder participatory approach. It alleges that in order to operate as democratically as possible, decisions have to pass through multiple committees and actors, which holds up the resettlement and compensation of victims.After experiencing these persistent frustrations with Renova, victims have turned to state and federal prosecutors as well to NGOs such as Caritas and MAB for help in mobilizing their right to remedy and justice. Nonetheless, these defenders of the victims often lament the absence of any legislation or precedent they can follow to ensure the rights of victims are acknowledged and respected.The case of the Fundãotailings dam break came after a series of corporate induced disasters that also affected the lives and livelihoods of thousands of innocent people (for e.g. BP Horizon Deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Rana Plaza collapse in Bangladesh in 2013 and Vale’s Feijãotailings dam collapse in Brazil in 2019). Each of these cases approached the remediation of victims differently. These cases also highlightthe urgent need for global binding norms that can provide minimum standards for meaningful access to remedy for victims of mass corporate irresponsibility.The example from Mariana additionally draws our attention to the stark limitations of participatory approaches, when victims are not actively empowered and involved in their design. As illustrated in Maher (2021) a seemingly sophisticated and slick operation such as the Renova Foundation can act in a disingenuous way. It presented to the world that it offers a seat at its table to everyone including victims when in reality victims hold no real power and remain deprived of their legitimate right to remedy, thus perpetuating their suffering for years.A global standard on access to remedy for victims of mass corporate irresponsibility should outlaw such deceitful manoeuvres by private actors. A global standard could quite easily be aggregated to the already established UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) third pillar of Access to Remedy. The UNGPs have on the whole been well embraced with at least over 350 corporate human rights policies in existence (see Business and Human Rights Resource Centre). At the present Pillar III of the UNGPs is quite general and applies to all types and scale of grievances encountered against corporate irresponsibility including mundane acts of dust pollution or workplace harassment. A more specific addition is needed for the redress of victims whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed by disaster events induced by business operations. Such standards must focus on closing loopholes and possibilities for business and state actors to instrumentalize and manipulate participation as a tool for sidestepping their obligations to provide effective and timely remedy to victims of corporate irresponsibility.A Portuguese version of this article, supplied by the author, can be found below.Não basta um lugar à mesa: as falhas da Fundação Renova no BrasilA aposta na participação da população atingida tornou-se uma ferramenta essencial para atores e empresas estatais na tentativa de conciliar conflitos socioambientais. Este artigo discute o mecanismo participativo não judicial inovador criado pelas mineiradoras multinacionais e o Estado brasileiro para dar o acesso à justiça para compensações e reparações pelas vítimas do pior desastre ambiental brasileiro. Com base em um extenso trabalho de campo em Mariana, Brasil, tento esclarecer a opacidade do modelo e processo de governança participativa na Fundação Renova (para uma análise mais detalhada, ver Maher, 2021). O artigo conclui que simplesmente não é suficiente ter apenas um ‘lugar à mesa’ em contextos de resolução de abusos de direitos humanos. Além disso, estratégias de participação que parecem uma charada é dizer ‘só para inglés ver’ podem e prolongam o sofrimento das vítimas. Concluo o artigo pedindo normas internacionais vinculantes para salvaguardar os direitos das vítimas afetadas pela irresponsabilidadenovembro de 2015, a barragem de rejeitos de Fundão, de propriedade da Samarco (uma joint venture entre a anglo-australiana BHP e a brasileira Vale), desabou em Mariana, Brasil, provocando a pior catástrofe ambiental da história do país. O colapso da barragem tirou a vida de 19 pessoas, e devastou as casas e/ou meios de subsistência de aproximadamente 23.000 famílias e até 3 milhões de pessoas.No vácuo de padrões vinculativos ou normas para remediação às vítimas de irresponsabilidade corporativa, a Samarco junto com o Estado brasileiro, sem consultar as vítimas, concordou em criar e financiar uma fundação supostamente independente chamada Renova para abordar as reparações e indenizações às vítimas. A Renova defendeu sua legitimidade declarando-se melhor posicionada para fornecer uma indenização e reparação mais eficientes às vítimas/atingidos do que os canais judiciais mais tradicionais.No entanto, essa afirmação revelou ter pouca autenticidade. As vítimas do rompimento da barragem de Fundão da Samarco ainda não foram reassentadas em suas novas casas e povoado há mais de 5 anos e meio desde o desastre. Os milhares de atingidos também foram negados pela fundação o direito de reconhecimento como vítimas legítimas.De um dia para o outro a Fundação Renova se tornou a fundação com mais recursos financeiros no Brasil em julho de 2016. Foi estabelecida como uma fundação governada por várias partes interessadas (stakeholders) com um intrincado arranjo de governança. A governança da Renova envolve 70 entidades participantes que incluem sociedade civil, poder público, acadêmicos e até as próprias vítimas para garantir que a justiça seja feita de forma transparente e respeitosa com os direitos humanos, garantindo ao mesmo tempo que ‘nenhuma parte envolvida tenha controle sobre a decisão ‘(Site da Fundação Renova, 2019). Por meio de seu modelo de governança de múltiplos-atores, a Renova afirma trabalhar com uma abordagem participativa e dialógica.Ademais, a Renova adotou uma estratégia de comunicação agressiva para mostrar seus investimentos em reparações e compensações, conforme documentado nas centenas de vídeos brilhantes produzidos profissionalmente no site da mesma. Como tal, seria legítimo presumir que os atingidos ficariam contentes com a abordagem da Renova, mas isso esta longe da verdade como descobri durante três visitas de trabalho de campo a Mariana entre 2019-20. Apesar dessa abordagem participativa e democrática em relação às compensações justas e em conformidade com os direitos humanos, devemos fazer a seguinte pergunta: Por que a Renova não foi eficaz até o momento aos olhos das vítimas?A chave para entender esse enigma está em entender onde e com quem o poder de tomada de decisão repousa na estrutura de governança da Renova. Apesar de sua forma elaborada de governança democrática, apenas o Conselho Curador pode tomar decisões sobre como gastar os recursos financeiros da fundação, enquanto os outros membros e órgãos podem ser consultados e, portanto, ouvidos. O Conselho Curador sempre foi composto por representantes de ambas as empresas de mineração. A partir de agosto de 2018, os tribunais determinaram que o Conselho Curador deveria incorporar dois representantes das vítimas e atingidos. No entanto, isso nunca se materializou devido ao temor das assimetrias de poder e da participação simbólica de apenas duas vítimas em comparação com seis representantes das mineradoras. Consequentemente, as vítimas descreveram a participação e o diálogo com a Renova como uma farsa.Vale ressaltar que até o momento a Renova gastou mais de R$ 13 bilhões de reais (US $ 2,52 bilhões) em indenizações e reparações. No entanto, as vítimas que entrevistei reclamaram que não viram os benefícios desse dinheiro. Como uma vítima me disse com frequencia, eles são apenas uma ‘mercadoria ou troca de moeda’ para a Renova criar projetos e receber propina. Com muita indignação, além do pagamento de aluguel para uma casa temporária e uma bolsa para alimentação, os mais atingidos pelo rompimento da barragem teriam recebido a menor parte desses gastos pela Fundação, apesar da Renova empregar milhares de pessoas direta e indiretamente.A resposta mais comum, na minha opinião, sobre o quão bem a Renova documenta sua reparação aos atingidos,é como o ditado “só para inglês ver.” Os atingidos e seus defensores explicaram como uma das principais áreas de gastos da Renova sempre foi na comunicação e marketing de si mesma.Um tema recorrente ao longo das conversas com os atingodos com respeito a Renova, foi seu atraso persistente ou táticas de protelação (ou ‘enrolar’ em linguagem coloquial) em seu reassentamento em Bento Rodrigues. Isso pode ser explicado pela disposição da fundação de, por um lado, sempre dialogar com os atingidos e, por outro, sua ineficiência no reassentamento dos atingidos. Isso nos ajuda a entender por que os atingidos percebem que as práticas participativas da Renova são uma mera farsa – só para inglês ver. O resultado disso tem sido o agravamento das frustrações e descontentamento entre as vítimas que veem a Renova como inepta e desinteressada em fazer justiça quanto às suas queixas legítimas. Os atingidos afirmam que esses atrasos tem contribuído para a epidemia de depressão e suicídios vividos em Mariana nos últimosamenizar a exasperação dos atrasos, a Renova oferece os atingidos a chance de liquidar suas reivindicações de indenizações em um centro de mediação supostamente independente, que também financia e opera. Nesses centros de mediação conhecidos como Programas de Indenização Mediada (PIM), os atingidos podem entrar e sair em poucas horas com um cheque pelos danos sofridos. Os atingidos e seus defensores denunciaram essa prática como inescrupulosa, devido aos valores alarmantes de indenização que as vítimas pagaram (as vezes pela faixa de US $ 100-150, de acordo com os entrevistados). Chegar a um acordo nos centros do PIM também implica que os atingidos abram mão de quaisquer direitos de exigir mais pagamentos ou de tomarem medidas legais futuras contra a Samarco.A principal defesa da Renova contra as acusações de sua ineficiência e violação dos direitos humanos básicos na entrega da indenização para os atingidos, tem sido desviar audaciosamente a culpa sobre a natureza burocrática de sua abordagem participativa de múltiplas partes interessadas. A fundação alega que, para funcionar da forma mais democrática possível, as decisões devem passar por múltiplos comitês e atores, o que faz demorar o reassentamento e a indenização dos atingidos.Após sofrer essas frustrações persistentes com a Renova, os atingidos recorreram a promotores estaduais e federais, bem como a ONGs como a Caritas e o MAB para obter ajuda na mobilização de seu direito à reparação e justiça. No entanto, os defensores das vítimas muitas vezes lamentam a ausência de qualquer legislação ou precedente que possam seguir para garantir que os direitos das vítimas sejam reconhecidos e respeitados.O caso da ruptura da barragem de rejeitos de Fundão veio após uma série de desastres induzidos por corporações que também afetaram as vidas e meios de subsistência de milhares de pessoas inocentes (por exemplo, BP Horizon Deepwater no Golfo do México em 2010, colapso de Rana Plaza em Bangladesh em 2013 e rompimento da barragem de rejeitos do Feijão da Vale no Brasil em 2019). Cada um desses casos abordou a reparação das vítimas de forma diferente. Ademais, esses casos também destacam a necessidade urgente de normas vinculantes globais que possam fornecer padrões mínimos para um acesso significativo a recursos para vítimas de irresponsabilidade corporativa em massa.O exemplo de Mariana também chama nossa atenção para as limitações gritantes das abordagens participativas, quando as vítimas não são ativamente capacitadas e envolvidas em seu projeto. Conforme revelado em Maher (2021), uma operação aparentemente sofisticada e engenhosa como a Fundação Renova pode agir de forma dissimulada, além de apresentar ao mundo que oferecer um ‘lugar à mesa’ para todos, incluindo os atingidos, quando na realidade, as vítimas não detêm nenhum poder real e permanecem privadas de seus direitos legítimos de reparação, perpetuando assim seu sofrimento por anos.Um padrão global de acesso a reparações para vítimas de irresponsabilidade corporativa em massa deveria proibir tais manobras enganosas de atores privados. Um padrão global poderia ser facilmente agregado ao já estabelecido terceiro pilar dos Princípios Orientadores das Nações Unidas sobre Negócios e Direitos Humanos (UNGPs) de Acesso a Reparação. Em geral, os UNGPs foram bem adotados com pelo menos mais de 350 políticas corporativas de direitos humanos existentes (consulte o Business and Human Rights Resource Centre). No presente Pilar III do UNGPs é bastante geral e se aplica a todos os tipos e escala de queixas encontradas contra irresponsabilidade corporativa, incluindo atos mundanos de poluição por poeira ou assédio no local de trabalho. Um acréscimo mais específico é necessário para a reparação das vítimas cujas vidas e meios de subsistência foram destruídos por eventos de desastre induzidos por operações comerciais a focar em fechar brechas e possibilidades para que atores empresariais e estatais instrumentalizem e manipulem a participação da população atingida como uma ferramenta para contornar suas obrigações de fornecer soluções eficazes e oportunas às vítimas da irresponsabilidadeReading on E-International RelationsA Seat at the Table: International LGBTQ Rights at the United NationsWho is Not a Refugee?The Pandemic in Brazil: Normality as NecropoliticsVenezuelans in Brazil: Challenges of ProtectionBusiness and Human Rights, Poverty and Power: Bridging the Political Economy GapBolsonaro’s Brazil in Times of COVID-19: A Necropolitical PharmakonAbout The Author(s)Rajiv Maher is an Assistant Professor at EGADE Business School del Tecnológico de Monterrey.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/28/nineteenth-century-migration-trends-and-the-role-of-women/,Nineteenth Century Migration Trends and the Role of Women,Kendra Morancy,Jun 28 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.Gendered roles and the role of women within the international community and the international space has shifted for generations. These paradigms have been challenged by feminist movements and ideals, human rights activists, and international conventions and agreements – all to bring us all closer to notions of gender equality, equality of the sexes, and international and national standards that promote the dignity of each and every individual in society. In this chapter, I analyze how the shifts in migration trends have affected women globally. To answer this question, I conducted a literature review using three primary sources that answered questions, such as: how have women migration trends changed? What are the trends that influenced this change? What are the causes and consequences of female dominated flows of migration? And what are the patterns of labor market incorporation of women migrants?Trends DefinedThe most significant trend concerning women and international migration is that, by the last half of the 20th century, they dominated the largest of international migration flows (Pedraza 1991, 304). This trend goes against the long-standing stereotype that the average migrant is a single male and that the women and their families follow. While studies do show that women generally have moved across international borders to reunite with their families, this is not always the case (Pedraza 1991, 304). By 1984, males who were of working age only accounted for one-third of all immigrants into the United States (Pedraza 1991, 304). It is clear that by the late 1980s, the demographic of immigrants had transformed. The next question is why? Why were more women migrating throughout the 20th century?The question of ‘why’ can be answered through multiple factors. The first and most obvious is the purpose of family reunification. According to Pedraza (1991), family reunification is what accounts for the sex distribution of immigrants in the US, as well as the availability of jobs in the health care industry, the socioeconomic conditions of the state from which they are emigrating, and lastly the presence of a US military base. I did not find suitable evidence to argue that the presence of a military base had a major impact on women immigrating the US I did have substantial evidence to prove the role of family in women’s migration trends. Often, migration is a part of survival for families, which then changes the dynamic between the individual and the household. Grasmuck and Pessar (quoted in Pedraza 1991, 308) state that, ‘since gender is central to household decision making, then gender is also a key factor of immigration’. If we follow this line of thinking, then we would also think that women actually have some power within their households across the various groups of migrants. Pedraza (1991) uses various examples of different migrant women’s experiences as immigrants into the US to highlight the impact of family reunification on the decision to move, which I discusssome cases, the act of migrating is a way of rewriting traditional family dynamics. In one study of the Dominican Republic, women had to stop contributing to their families through subsistence farming because of the rise in commercial farming (Pedraza 1991, 308). This economic transition ruined the structure of the traditional family in various ways. Sons were no longer seen as assets, but extra mouths to feed. Sons were then expected to emigrate to alleviate family concerns. The shift towards commercial farming also created a dependence on the husbands that the women had not experienced before. At that point, emigration was a way to escape complete dependency on their husbands (Pedraza 1991, 309). Immigration for women, in many cases, was a way of gaining more autonomy over their lives. This is evident in the way that women would often postpone returning to their home countries or to not return at all. Returning home was viewed as an early retirement from their jobs and a loss of their newfound freedom (Pedraza 1991, 310). This seemed to be the norm in women from developing countries overall, even in other regions of the world. In a 1989 study by Gugler, women in Sub-Saharan Africa also had to leave behind working the farms due to economic changes and the creation of job opportunities in the cities (Pedraza 1991, 310). In addition to job opportunities and newfound freedom, these women also gained higher life expectancies with the options of health care and even education.These examples of women migration show that the second driving force behind the high rates of women migrating to the US is the transformation of social and economic structures in sending and receiving societies. This is evident in the cases that were presented, such as in the study on maquiladoras at the US-Mexican border. This 1983 study found that 85 percent of the workers in export-manufacturing plants along the Mexican border were female (Galhardi 1997). This trend of Mexican women flooding the US-Mexican border for work is a result of the new jobs that were generated in the service and manufacturing sectors in industrialized countries such as the US.Another case of women emigrating due to social and economic changes is the plight of Irish women. A 1983 study by Hsia Diner says that Irish women were pushed by poverty, landlessness, social and economic dislocation, and the aftermath of the famine (Pedraza 1991, 320). This dislocation was an effect of the transition from an agrarian, feudal society to an industrial, capitalist one, much like the case in many other countries discussed above (Pedraza 1991, 313). Other factors that pushed Irish women to migrate were the lack of men to marry and a lack of jobs. Overall, Ireland held fewer and fewer attractions for women. One interesting trend involving the emigration of Irish women is that, once one emigrated to the US, that usually started a train reaction of others following suit. Sisters, mothers, nieces, and aunts would attempt to escape the ‘interlocking relationship of land-family-marriage’ to end up working as domestic service workers in the US (Pedraza 1991, 320).Cuban women were different from Irish and the Mexican women in the way that they migrated. When these women immigrated to the US, they came to participate in the labor force as well, but they would eventually stop working to return to the Cuban value of women staying at home. Myra Marx Ferree calls this ‘employment without liberation’ (Marx Ferre 1985, 520). These women seemed to want to maintain the traditional Cuban household dynamic and worked only to help the family (Pedraza, 1991, 314). This may have been due to their original social class in their home country. Since these women would have experienced the luxuries that come with having a middle-class income in a developing state, they would obviously have aspirations to return back to this status.was evident that the type of work a woman immigrant did was influenced by several factors. One of the factors was her home life. Demanding jobs like domestic housework interfered with having a potential family life, but it did give them the consistency to save money. Domestic work was also safer than factory work, was not affected by economic downturns, and exposed them to middle-class American standards. The money that domestic workers earned allowed them to achieve upward mobility sooner and would include a potential future marriage, funds for a future business, or an education for them and their kids. These trends actually led to a quicker upward social mobility for Irish women than for Irish men. More importantly, there was also a trend of certain jobs being exclusively advertized to certain groups across racial, ethnic, social, and economic status. This reserved the unskilled, unprotected, and poorly paid jobs for women and people of color (Pedraza 1991, 315). A prime example of this was New York’s garment industry. In the late 19th century, there was the inception of a market for ready-made and mass-produced women’s clothing because of urbanization and the creation of a national market. Since this market demand began to grow around the time of a massive influx of Russian Jews and Italians, they were the main ones to enter these spaces. In addition to Russian Jews and Italians, Puerto Rican immigrant women also became a part of the garment industry. What made these three different ethnic groups flock to the garment industry was the level of skill required to fulfill this job in addition to the demand. Women who needed to work at home because of family obligations could do that by working as subcontractors (Pedraza 1991, 316). Today, the garment industry is still made up primarily of Latin American and Asian women migrants.There are some notable differences between the different women migrant groups and their work status once they entered the US. This is seen with Cuban women and other Latin American women. Cuban women only worked to sustain the family until they reached American middle-class status and, once that was achieved, they would leave the work force. It is a known fact that a large percentage of Cuban refugees were already skilled and educated in their home country. Their goal was to help their husbands become self-employed in business. Mexican women immigrants would continue to work in their labor roles regardless of their marital status or family obligation. Mexican women would work the garment industry or in the other factories to help generate funds for their families, but there was also the possibility of supporting a home without a male head of household. As a result, Mexican women pursued personal fulfillment.The more successful migrants come from English-speaking countries and have higher levels of education. These factors heavily affect their migration journey and job placement. English speakers with higher levels of education are able to assimilate into the US economy and potentially obtain jobs that require higher skilled workers. One key characteristic is that one extra year of education increased their labor market participation levels by 2.3 percent and their annual wages by between $3,000–4,000 (Pfeiffer et al. 2007, 171). Even though the majority of the literature I review focuses on migrants moving to the US, it is important to note that the receiving country of all migrants influences the genders flows in relation to their economic needs (Pfeiffer et al. 2007, 29). An example of this is the garment industry and the rise of factories during the 20th century being an opportunity primarily for migrant women. The variation in these women’s earning power is also attributed to the political and economic statuses of their home countries. Latin Americans had lower levels of market participation and performance in correlation with lower levels of education. Women migrants from Western Europe would have a higher earning power and a smoother transition into the US than those from less-developed states. Africans and Eastern Europeans had higher levels of market participation. Education levels of migrant women who arrived in the US in the 1990s varied across countries and regions. Where they obtained their education was more important. This study demonstrates that the group with a larger portion of tertiary educated migrants were from Central America, Asia, and the Caribbean. These groups gained this education after they migrated to the US in comparison with European migrants who gained their higher education, if any, at home (Pfeifferet al. 2007, 159). The need to gain further higher education once they migrated is linked to the need to obtain stronger English-speaking skills as well as to move up in socioeconomic status. Other notable factors concerning a migrant woman’s success were the number of children they had, age, and experience.Government policies play a noteworthy role in the gender imbalances in global migration (Pedraza, 1991, 310). These policies are what made farming so unsustainable in countries such as the Dominican Republic and along Sub-Saharan Africa. Pricing policies brought down the value of cash crops and made it hard for local families to compete with big agri-businesses. Government policy in Lesotho actually restricted the migration flows of men and women. A 1983 study by Wilkinson proves that influx control laws were put in place in South Africa to restrict the movement of women (Pedraza, 1991, 310). This caused a predominantly male flow of migrant workers crossing the border into South Africa. As a result, the migration of women in search of jobs was internal within Lesotho. In some cases, immigration laws can favor family reunification, which will attract migrants who have families or single daughter or sisters who want to send for their female counterparts. In 1986, the US Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which was a positive for women and men migrants crossing the US-Mexican border (Schiff, Morrison, and Sjöblom 2008).Illicit migration is also worth mentioning in discussing the shift of women migration trends. This is because illicit migration is a gendered way of migrating internationally. Especially in the case of human trafficking. Why? The social status of women and children. If we look at human trafficking in Latin America and the Caribbean, the majority of trafficking victims are young adult women between the ages of 18 and 25, and in many cases between 12 and 17. This migration can be internal, such as in the case of the Dominican Republic or from the Dominican Republic to Haiti and vice versa. The driving factors for the victims are similar to those of other migrants, which include economic necessity, lack of education, and their role as single heads of households (Langberg 2005, 5). These illicit migrants face far more barriers than other, more legal migrants because of the nature of their ‘work’. They will neither take home the majority of their earnings nor have the possibility of upward social mobility all because of their line of work and the social stigma aligned with it whether they work voluntarily or not. These women are trapped in a cycle that many cannotRemarksWhether legally or illegally, all of the trends in international migration concerning women are driven by the same factors. These factors include poverty, political and social transformations, gender inequalities, family reunification, and policy changes. The role that each of these groups fulfill in the US labor market differs according to the market needs of the receiving country, which in this case is primarily the US. The general trend is that the more educated English speakers have a more successful transition into the US market, which is evident in their higher earning capabilities and socioeconomic mobility. External factors that cannot change, such as race and ethnicity, also affect these immigrant women’s abilities to emigrate and their assimilation within the US. The theme of self-realization and economic independence was very consistent across most groups that were mentioned except for Cuban-American women. That was due to their prior socioeconomic status in their home country and the way that they emigrated with the family wealth-building ideal. The illicit migrants do not get to enjoy the self-realization that the other migrant women do because of the social stigma and the dangers that come with sex work or labor trafficking. The wages are either too low, unsustainable, come with no safety, or provide no autonomy over one’s life."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/27/assessing-one-state-and-two-state-proposals-to-solve-the-israel-palestine-conflict/,Assessing One-State and Two-State Proposals to Solve the Israel-Palestine Conflict,Jeremy Pressman,Jun 27 2021,"In May 2021, the confrontation in Israel-Palestine again assumed center stage with many people wondering if this conflict would ever end (International Crisis Group 2021). The human costs have been high. Millions of Palestinians and Israelis suffered mental and emotional anxiety. Hundreds were killed, thousands wounded, and tens of thousands displaced from their homes. Given the Israeli occupation and Israel’s advanced military firepower, over 90% of the casualties and displaced were Palestinians. In theory, one way the conflict could come to an end is through a negotiated diplomatic outcome, but what would such an outcome look like? In this article, I consider the two most-commonly discussed negotiated solutions to the conflict: 1) one state with equal rights for all Palestinians and Israelis in what is today Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank and 2) two states, a State of Israel and a State of Palestine alongside each other. Each resolution has benefits and drawbacks; neither option is clearly more beneficial or more likely. Moreover, there is no independent decision rule that makes clear how to weigh the pros and cons and choose the better option.One caveat: A discussion of one-state and two-state solutions is not exhaustive of all the options. The status quo is the current reality and may remain in place for years. In that reality, Israel is the only independent country (the Jewish State), Israeli settlements in the West Bank continue to grow, the Israeli occupation continues, and the Palestinian Authority has quite limited power. The Israeli right has advocated for sub-state options for Palestinians (e.g. autonomy, self-rule) as a long-term resolution, but such approaches have little support among Palestinians.A one-state solutionA one-state solution means there would be a single country made up of pre-1967 Israel, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank (Abunimah 2007; Azoulay and Ophir 2012; Lustick 2019; Munayyer 2019; and Tilley 2005). As a placeholder name, let’s call this one, sovereign state “the Holy Land.” Every person who lives between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea would have equal individual rights, regardless of their ethnic or religious identity. They could live anywhere they want in the Holy Land, and they would have the right to vote in national elections. The capital would be in Jerusalem, and the government would include Jews and Palestinians. As I will further explain below, one state could be solely based on equal individual rights, or it could be a binational state meaning the two communities (Jews, Palestinians) have some communal rights as well.The central obstacle to this one-state vision is about Israel’s self-definition today and how, if at all, that would transition to a single state with full equality for Palestinians and Israelis. Israel as the Jewish State is not compatible with the Holy Land because the latter assumes symbols, laws, and government policies do not favor Jews over Palestinians. Yet Israel today privileges Jews in many ways, e.g. in migration, housing, employment, political rights, and treatment by security organs of the state. Why would Israeli Jews willingly forfeit those advantages? Few states ever willingly modified their self-definition or national identity in such a significant fashion due to external demands rather than internalcould the Holy Land serve as the fulfillment of Zionism and as a refuge for world Jewry if it was no longer defined as the Jewish State? What, for example, would happen to the Law of Return, which gives a Jew from anywhere in the world the right to become a citizen of Israel? The law is a key pillar of the Jewish superiority built into the State of Israel, the very kind of differentiation that undergirds the conception of Israel as an apartheid state (Human Rights Watch, 2021). But the law is also tied to the idea of Israel as a safe haven for Jews, somewhere they may automatically seek protection if things go badly in their home country (think violent anti-Semitism).In concrete terms, it is difficult to imagine how the shift would take place in the state’s armed forces and security and intelligence community. Would Palestinians be integrated into the Israeli military and police to bring the numbers closer to 50/50 and to put Palestinians in key leadership roles? Would Palestinians leaders be given access to Israel’s nuclear secrets? That seems hard to imagine and yet that is what equality mandates. At the same time, most Israeli Jews would be reluctant to concede exclusive control of the state’s security decisions, fearful that they would not be protected in crisis moments.What would equality mean in socioeconomic terms? In the status quo, Israeli Jews have many times the income and wealth of Palestinians. Would equality involve significant economic redistribution, something that itself could lead to further Israeli Jewish opposition to one state with equality? For comparison, the unification of East and West Germany faced such economic challenges with gaps that were not as stark.One possibility is that the one state could be a binational state with reserved communal rights. The national civic identity and the Jewish or Palestinian ethnic identity could both continue. How exactly to do that would be complicated. Fundamentally, would it be based on new symbols and ideas (e.g. one new flag) or mutual recognition of dual symbols (e.g. two flags: Israel and Palestine’s current flags)? Is it possible to imagine a definition of the Jewish community as a subset of the Holy Land that would allow the country to function on the basis of equality and satisfy some or much of the sentiment of Israeli Jewish nationalism (Kelman 1999)?A parallel problem would arise with the Palestinian right of return. Palestinians, with backing from international law and UN resolutions, claim a right to return to their homes and land from pre-1948, the years before the establishment of the State of Israel. Over 5 million Palestinians are registered as refugees with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). While past surveys suggest many of the refugees might not want to return permanently, but might be content with visiting and receiving compensation, if even 10 or 20% moved to the Holy Land, it would have a notable effect on the Palestinian share of the population (Greenberg 2003). A majority of Jews would oppose the influx. But many Palestinians would object to any resolution that does not acknowledge and address the right of return. After all, Palestinian collective trauma is rooted in forced displacement, especially 1948 and the Nakba, the catastrophe of Israeli expulsion and lack of return. A strong sense of Palestinian identity and security may depend upon directly addressing that initial displacement and its consequences.Even if an Israeli-Palestinian agreement did not provide full redress for Palestinian refugees, a limited number – limited by housing availability and financial resources – could simply move to the towns from which they or their ancestors had been expelled or fled (in the cases where such towns and cities still exist). They might not be able to re-enter their exact house in, say, Jaffa or Haifa, but some apartments or homes would likely be for rent or sale, a limited, market-based answer to Palestinian dispossession. Implementing a solution for Palestinian refugees raises many questions (Abu-Sitta 2008; and Scheindlin,a one-state solution, Israeli settlers would have gains and losses. Israeli settlements are towns and outposts built in the West Bank since Israel occupied the land in the 1967 War. First, most countries consider settlements illegal under international law. With an agreed-upon Israeli-Palestinian resolution and the end of the Israeli occupation, that would no longer be an issue. Second, at first glance, it appears Israeli settlers could stay where they are now. Israel would not need to withdraw settlers or close down any settlements since everyone would already be living in the same state, the Holy Land.That said, Israeli settlements in the West Bank have often been built on Palestinian land and that could open the door to legal wrangling. In the State of Israel to this point, the government, the judiciary, and the military have aided and abetted the illegal expropriation of Palestinian land for establishing or expanding settlements. But as the law and courts changed in this new one state, the Holy Land, presumably that favoritism toward Israeli Jewish claims would fade. Could the legal or political system start to un-do the questionable legal-territorial basis of many Israeli settlements? Settlements might not be as stable as they are in the status quo of Israeli occupation.In addition, Jewish-only settlements would no longer be able to exclude Palestinians from living in them since the basis of the Holy Land is equality for all. In fact, even in what is today pre-1967 Israel, the use of social suitability as a criteria for who is allowed to live in a town – and the way it is often applied to exclude Palestinians – would have to end for equality to take hold. Settlements in the status quo are largely reflective of housing segregation, not equality. Many Jewish settlers might oppose such a shift. All that said, a housing exception would be if the one state was framed in binational terms and granted Jews and Palestinians communal rights, too, thereby allowing separate housing by community.The deepest challenge to the success of one state should it come into being is whether Jews and Palestinians as co-citizens could form working partnerships, or at least co-exist, in a way that would allow the single state and society to function without frequent ethnic tension and violence. The May 2021 Jew-on-Palestinian and Palestinian-on-Jew violence inside pre-1967 Israel does not bode well for such a possibility. More generally, some analysts worry the tendency toward inter-group hostility, not cooperation, is dominant (Haklai 2021; Olesker 2021; Sucharov 2021). At the same time, tens of thousands of Palestinian and Jewish citizens of Israel stood side-by-side at protests denouncing war and violence and calling for working together. There are organizations that illustrate successful Arab-Jewish partnerships and the values that could help one state function amicably such as the Hand-in-Hand schools, the Oasis of Peace, the Palestine-Israel Journal, the Parents’ Circle, and Combatants for Peace. It might be difficult to prevail in the face of hyper-nationalism, but there are kernels of a mutual and stable future.Meanwhile, though, certain actors in society might well be trying to cause the single state to fail. Some political parties and leaders will make hypernationalist, ethnoreligious, or supremacist appeals that stoke inter-group animosity and conflict. Even if such forces could be contained or marginalized enough to push through to a one-state resolution, they would not disappear. Spoilers might continually seek to undermine and unravel the agreed-upon resolution. In short, defending the new status quo would be a continuing project rather than a static obstacle to overcome.One state would embody several other advantages not already mentioned. It would have all the attributes of a sovereign state. There would be no debate about its borders. The state and its borders would receive wide international recognition. The Palestinian drive for self-determination would be addressed and, arguably, achieved. Palestinians could again freely enjoytwo-state solutionA two-state solution means there would be two states, a State of Israel and a State of Palestine located alongside each other (Beauchamp 2021). The State of Israel already exists as an independent country; its borders would largely revert to what they were from 1949-1967. The State of Palestine would be located in the Gaza Strip and a contiguous section of the West Bank that encompasses 95% or more of the West Bank territory. Jerusalem would serve as the capital of both states, with Israel’s sovereign capital in West Jerusalem and Palestine’s sovereign capital in East Jerusalem, though an exact division is complicated by the Israeli settlements (neighborhoods) that ring the core of East Jerusalem. The Old City of Jerusalem, and perhaps some adjacent holy sites, would be 1) shared 2) overseen by an international committee 3) or somehow divided between the two states. (A common two-state variant is a confederal plan, but I do not discuss it here. See Avishai and Bahour 2021 and Scheindlin and Waxman 2016.)Israeli settlements that are located along the Green Line, the dividing line between Israel and the West Bank prior to the 1967 War, would be annexed to Israel. Israel would compensate Palestine with other land adjacent to the West Bank or Gaza at a 1:1 ratio. Israeli settlements in the midst of the State of Palestine would be closed and the Israeli Jewish settlers withdrawn, though a small number of Jewish settlers might seek permission to stay on in the new State of Palestine. A token number of Palestinian refugees would be admitted to Israel. All Palestinian refugees would be eligible for compensation and could move to the new State of Palestine. Palestine’s armed forces very likely would have certain additional constraints, at least for an initial time period. The states would have to come to agreements on dividing many other resources such as airspace and water. Israel would remain self-defined as the Jewish state. It could continue to promote the idea of Israel as a safe haven for Jews; it could continue the Law of Return allowing Jews from anywhere access to Israeli citizenship.In contrast, the Palestinian Right of Return would be fulfilled only in a narrow sense. The vast majority of Palestinian refugees would not have the ability to return to their family’s home and land inside that were located in what is today the State of Israel. Rather, they could get financial compensation, maybe some symbolic acknowledgment of their plight, and access to the new State of Palestine (comprising about 22% of historic Palestine). Whether this would satisfy most Palestinian refugees is an open question.Most Israeli settlers would stay in place, but a sizable minority would be removed from their homes. Perhaps half a million settlers would stay in place in East Jerusalem and in settlements along the Green Line. But 100,000 or more (or fewer?) would move; implementation would be challenging (Krieger 2012; Sasley and Sucharov 2011). This could well spark strong opposition from the Israeli settler movement. From the Israeli government’s perspective, the whole point of keeping most settlers in place would be to try to minimize political opposition to a two-state solution. I don’t know what would happen to settlers who had inserted themselves in the midst of large Palestinian populations in East Jerusalem in places like Silwan, Sheikh Jarrah, or the Mount of Olives.The status of Jews in Palestine and Palestinians in Israel would remain challenging to handle for exclusionary ethnonational definitions of statehood. Israeli irredentist organizations could come into being to protest the removal of Jewish settlers from parts of the West Bank. Palestinian irredentist organizations could come into being to protest the incomplete resolution of the right of return and the small share of the territory that constitutes the new State of Palestine.The same risk of inter-ethnic tension that I discussed in relation to one state would apply to a shared city of Jerusalem. In that city, Palestinians and Israelis would need to work together as partners on multiple issues, or at least find ways to co-exist. Palestine would incorporate the Palestinians in East Jerusalem who mostly are currently residents, but not citizens, of Israel. Furthermore, the Israeli citizenry would still be 20% Palestinian so internal Jewish-Palestinian relations would remain a related issue. Some Israeli Jews might call for the revocation of Israeli citizenship for Palestinians and their expulsion to the new State ofIsrael would have all the attributes of a sovereign state, Palestine would likely have some limits on its sovereignty, especially in terms of what would be allowed in its military and police forces. A peace agreement might detail monitoring and supervision provisions involving third-parties or an Israeli military presence on Palestine’s borders with Egypt and Jordan. There would need to be an extensive negotiation about the border between the states as well as how Palestinians would transit between the two parts of the state, what are today called Gaza and the West Bank. Once that was agreed upon, the states and their borders would receive wide international recognition. The Palestinian drive for self-determination would be achieved.Many members of the international community support the two-state solution, including the European Union, the League of Arab States, Russia, the United Nations, and the United States. But Israeli-Palestinian negotiators, especially in 2000-2001 (Oslo/Camp David/Taba) and 2007-2008 (Annapolis), have failed to reach agreement on a two-state solution (Pressman 2003; Avishai 2011).One point of note is that the outline I have presented here of a two-state solution reflects both Israel’s bargaining advantage as the more powerful party and the changes on the ground wrought by Israeli settlements. Absent such leverage, for example, the logical dividing line would be the Green Line, and all Israeli settlers would have to move. Or, how to share Jerusalem as a capital is much more complex because of Israeli Jewish settlers in and around East Jerusalem.Weighing the optionsOn four criteria for comparing the two options, a two-state solution probably does better on these four metrics, but neither option looks especially promising or easier to achieve. Financial cost is a fifth possible criteria that I do not address here.Clarity of blueprint – The two-state solution has more major, unresolved issues. For the two-state solution, where exactly would the border be drawn? Which Israeli settlements would be withdrawn? What counts as a settlement ‘along the Green line?’ How many, if any, Palestinian refugees would be allowed to move into Israel? What would be the status of Jerusalem’s Old City? What restrictions would be placed on Palestinian military and police forces? For a one-state solution, the main question is whether Jewish privilege would be fully eliminated or transformed into Jewish communal rights.Popular support among Israelis and Palestinians – Polling suggests a two-state solution is more popular than a one-state solution among Palestinians and Israelis, but the levels of support vary significantly among polls (PCPSR 2021; Palestinian-Israeli Pulse 2020). In 2020-21, it is uncertain whether any solution definitively has majority support. Moreover, respondents in the same survey may have different ideas about what exactly one- and two-state solutions entail. Political feasibility – Neither option seems politically feasible by which I mean it is hard to see how a plan would overcome existing political opponents in the government and public sphere. A one-state solution has to overcome widespread Israeli Jewish opposition. And since Israel holds the territorial cards, that widespread Israeli Jewish opposition cannot be ignored. The exact form of one state would determine the level of Palestinian opposition. A two-state solution faces opposition from major actors and their supporters in both societies (Likud and the Israeli right; Hamas). Israeli settlers and Palestinians refugees both have reasons that they might strongly oppose two states.International support – A one-state solution has little international support. A two-state solution has extensive international support, but no actor has been willing to use disincentives, e.g. UN Security Council action or trade/aid conditionality or withdrawal, to try to make it a reality, especially in terms of pressing Israel. This is particularly important in the EU-Israeli relationship and the US-Israeli relationship. The United States has been willing to press Palestinian actors in materialSalman. 2008. “The Implementation of the Right of Return,” Palestine-Israel Journal 15-16:3,Abunimah, Ali. 2007.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/27/unaccompanied-children-on-the-move-from-central-america-to-the-us-via-mexico/,Unaccompanied Children on the Move: From Central America to the US via Mexico,Monica Trigos Padilla,Jun 27 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.In the 2014 fiscal year, United States immigration authorities at the US-Mexico border apprehended 68,541 unaccompanied minors (Lind 2014). This garnered the attention of different stakeholders at regional and international levels. Following policy amendments, the number of unaccompanied minors decreased for a short period. However, in the 2019 fiscal year, the number reached its highest peak, increasing to 76,873 and representing a 58percent increase from 2018 (CRS 2019).According to the US government, ‘an unaccompanied minor is an immigrant who is under the age of 18 and not in the care of a parent or legal guardian at the time of entry, who is left unaccompanied after entry, and who does not have a family member or legal guardian willing or able to care for them in the arrival country’ (CRS 2019). It is important to mention that, while some travel completely alone, others may cross with their families and then become separated from them or may be left behind by smugglers or other people on the move.In 2019, around 85 percent of apprehended unaccompanied minors traveled to the US from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala (CRS 2019). Many of them fled domestic abuse and gang violence. Others attempted to cross the border to escape poverty, while others to reunite with their families. The journey to remain in the US gets harder as immigration policies get more rigid over time. This chapter will explore, through a storytelling and facts-based approach, the lives of the unaccompanied minors on the move. From their experiences in their countries of origin to what drives them to leave to the challenges they face throughout their travels and the unexpected hurdles along the way. Additionally, it will cover the current change in policies that concern them in Mexico and the US. Finally, it will conclude with recommendations amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on their livelihoods.‘The Black Hole’F is from Honduras; he is 14 years old. F knew his dad was being extorted by MS-13 for a long time. During an economic crisis, his dad lost his job, so he was not able to pay the extortion rate. One day, F was coming from the supermarket with his dad and witnessed his dad shot to death by two gang members. F was 10 when this happened. After this, he was continuously persecuted by gang members on his way to school every day. He left school. They waited for him outside his house. The options MS-13 gave him were to become part of the gang or die. It was the year 2014 and he decided to leave (live). He had an uncle that had already escaped up north in the United States. He joined a group of people that were leaving and also fleeing from violence and lack of opportunities. He didn’t tell his mother he was leaving; he couldn’t say goodbye. One day, very early, he left and started his journey.is from El Salvador; she is 16 years old. S lives with her mother and her mother’s boyfriend. Her mother’s boyfriend sexually assaults her. He is very violent with her and her mother. She is not safe at home, but neither is she safe on the streets. Gang members also sexually harass her in the streets, and every day is worse than the one before. She couldn’t leave her house, but she couldn’t live in her house either. After one night, while her mother was asleep, her boyfriend’s mother tried to rape S. She fought back and was able to escape, but she knew she couldn’t go back, so she went to her cousin’s even though she knew she wouldn’t be able to stay there for long. Her sister lived in the US. They had been planning S’s trip for a long time; they had some money. S didn’t have anywhere else to go. She had a few contacts and some money, so she was able to pay a smuggler. She had been advised that the journey to the US was going to be harder than life. She believed she couldn’t go through something harder than what she was already experiencing. She took a contraceptive injection that protected her for three months. It was the late summer of 2019.Although treated as such, the countries from the Northern Triangle – Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador –are not the same. Each of them has its characteristics and particularities. In structural factors for migration, however, they do share some similarities in push factors and all have communities that have networks of people already living in the US (Mexa Institute 2019, 2).Guatemala faces high levels of poverty and inequality (World Bank 2020). It has a population of 17.1 million, of which 53 percent is less than 24 years old. Guatemala has one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Latin America (Wilson, 2019). In 2018, Guatemala had a homicide rate of 39.9 homicides per 100,000 residents (UNODC 2018), though Guatemala’s City homicide rate was 42.5 homicides per 100,000 residents, above the national average (Asmann and O’Reilly 2020).Honduras is a low-income country, with high poverty and inequality levels (World Bank 2020). It has a population of 9.2 million, of which 51 percent is less than 24 years old (CIA 2020). One in four teenagers has become mothers at least once (Tejeda 2019). In 2018, Honduras had a homicide rate of 39.9 homicides per 100,000 residents, the third highest in Latin America (UNODC 2018).El Salvador has low levels of growth and poverty reduction is moderate (World Bank 2020). It has a population of 6.4 million, of which around 45 percent is less than 24 years old (CIA 2020). One-fourth of teenagers have become pregnant (O’toole 2018). In 2018, Honduras had a homicide rate of 52 homicides per 100,000 residents, the highest in Latin America (UNODC 2018).Gang violence, criminal organizations, and human traffickingThe Northern Triangle is one of the most violent regions of the world. Violence is not something recent, and has become more targeted towards children and youth in recent years. They have to decide between joining the gangs or criminal organizations and leaving. Hence, it becomes one of the main reasons of why they decide to flee with their families or as unaccompanied migrants (Acuna 2018).Guatemala went through a civil war from 1954 to 1996, which caused a lot of structural, organized and political violence that continues in the democratic and post-conflict periods. Additionally, gangs, such as MS-13 and Barrio 18, have wide control in Guatemala City. Extortion is one of the ways they exert this control (Asmann and O’Reilly 2020). Drug trafficking from organized crime has become very powerful in the country. This has repercussions not only on criminal activities, but also fluctuations in politics, security and the economy. Additionally, human trafficking networks have gained power and increased their presence and connections globally (Gutiérrez 2018, 13).the 1970s and 1990s, while Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua were facing civil wars, Honduras was relatively stable. However, its poverty levels and surroundings made it vulnerable to corruption and crime. Since the 1980s, it has been used as a trafficking route of drugs and weapons, becoming a strategic point for drug trafficking through to the US. Also, it was used by the US as an anti-communist ‘hub’ and became severely militarized (Insight Crime 2018). Additionally, there has been political turmoil and protests against the government, which have been repressed by security forces (Amnesty International 2018, 2). Poverty and the lack of solid institutions and social services provide perfect opportunities for gangs and criminal organizations to operate. It is estimated that there are between 12,000 and 40,000 active gang members throughout Honduras, especially in urban areas (as in Guatemala, MS-13 and Barrio 18 have a presence). Eighty percent of homicide cases are not investigated and 96 percent are never resolved (Davis, Jensen and Kitchens 2012). Additionally, institutions tend to collaborate with gangs and criminal organizations, and this well-known corruption and impunity decreases the trust, reliability and protection of the population (AJS 2018).During El Salvador’s civil war, many had to seek refuge in the US. Hence, some of these gangs initially formed in the 1980s in Los Angeles. Later, many of them were deported to El Salvador, ‘exporting the violence’ (O’toole 2018). MS-13 and Barrio 18 are two of the most important gangs that, over time, started controlling the country and gaining power due to the poverty and unequal conditions in El Salvador. Additionally, it is a country that has been regularly used as a route for drug trafficking (Clavel 2017, 1–2). It is believed that, currently, around 60,000 gang members are present in at least 247 of the 262 municipalities, controlling the streets and public spaces. Gangs use violence and extortion in public places and, with this, have increased their territorial control, which has expanded from urban to rural areas. The police and government security institutions have not been able to protect the population and there have been allegations of collaboration between them and the gangs (HRW 2020).These particular conditions in these three countries push children and youth to look for sources of income and protection and to search for their identities in the only alternatives they are given: to become part of a gang or flee for survival. Gangs and criminal organizations use violence, extortion, threats, drug trafficking, sexual and gender-based violence, disappearances, child recruitment (supposedly as young as 10 years old, though there is documentation of children between five to seven years old) and murder with impunity (AJS 2018). The main homicide victims from these gangs are young men from low-income areas. Additionally, children and youth are harassed on their way to schools, which leads them to drop out of school and end up with no access to education. Finally, those who decide to leave the gangs are potential victims of persecution (IRB 2018). Gangs have big networks not only inside each country, but also in the region, including in Mexico.Sexual and gender-based violenceThese three countries are extremely unsafe for women. In Guatemala, the homicide rate for women is more than three times higher than the global average. Honduras is almost 12 times more than the global average. Finally, in El Salvador, it is around six times higher than the global average (Ahmed 2019).Sexual and gender-based violence has a great impact on the lives of many women, girls and lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) persons in these three countries. ‘Gender based violence can take many forms including rape, slavery, forced impregnation/miscarriages, kidnapping/trafficking, forced nudity, and disease transmission, with rape and sexual abuse being among the most common’ (Manjoo and McRaith, 2011). It becomes one of the reasons that force individuals to flee. As mentioned before, this type of violence is perpetrated by gangs and criminal organizations, but also by family members, the police and other authorities. As with other crimes, these also face high levels of impunity, and a very low percentage of crimes end in convictions. The ones that do are not prosecuted forcefully. So, they are not given an alternative between being victims of this violence and leaving (living).ranks among the countries with the highest rate of violent deaths among women (9.7 in 100,000) (OCDE 2019). Eighty-eight percent of cases reported by women go unpunished. A total of 89 extortion-related homicides were reported in the second half of 2020 (OSAC 2020, 2). In Guatemala, three in every ten women who are murdered had reported being victims of violence or had restraining orders issued for their protection (Dotson 2018).In Honduras, young teenagers and girls are victims of gangs and criminal organizations. Women’s homicide rate is 10.9 out of 100,000, of which 96 percent remain unpunished. On the other hand, 60 percent of cases of violence against women are committed by a close family member (IMUMI 2020, 32–34). Girls not only suffer domestic physical violence, but also an unequal distribution of food, education and household workload. Also, the access that they have to sexual and reproductive health information and services in restricted. More than one-third of teenagers marry or get together (IMUMI 2020, 23–31). Women have no incentives to file a complaint, since they know that they will not receive protection and, additionally, are discouraged from filing complaints by the police.Women in El Salvador go through similar circumstances, as violence targeting girls and teenagers is found in the houses and on the streets. In 2017, 67 in 100 women have experienced a certain type of domestic violence. Of those, 34 have gone to the police to report it. In 2018, El Salvador was rated as the ‘most femicidal country in Latin America’ by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL 2018). ‘More than 60% of the 4,304 cases of sexual violence recorded in 2018 involved 12- to 17-year-olds, according to a report published the Organization of Salvadoran Women for Peace’ (Nóchez and Guzmán 2020).‘The Death Corridor’F walked, took rides and slept on the streets from Honduras to Guatemala, all his way to Mexico. He spoke with others, got informed about places, routes, food sources, dangers and safe places. Upon his arrival in Mexico, he crossed the Suchiate River in a raft, meeting other kids and adults that were doing the same. He wanted to be invisible because he knew he shouldn’t be seen. He knew that he could be persecuted, that he could be abducted or assaulted by criminal organizations or even the police. He didn’t want to be seen or heard. He followed the others, all of them mentioned that they had to find the beast (the train) and climb onto it. So, when they arrived, they did. He jumped on to continue his journey. He was told that he couldn’t fall asleep, because if he did, he would fall and be run over by the train and die or lose a leg. He also faced criminal organizations and policemen that tried to hurt him and robbed all his money. Though he was able to continue, he didn’t have anything to eat or drink. During his journey he tried to some shelter, sometimes finding a place to sleep indoors, sometimes just sleeping on the streets. Every night, he thought about his father and his family. Every night, he thought that his decision was a mistake, that he’d rather be dead, but he was too far now, and he had traveled for too long to give up. Finally, he arrived in Tijuana.S met with the smuggler who was already gathered with a group of people. They crossed through different places she couldn’t recognize. After some days, they crossed into Mexico. S kept receiving messages from her mother’s boyfriend threatening her. She was tired, but she knew she couldn’t go back. When reaching the highway, there was a container truck, the ‘guide’ opened the door and it was already full of people. They all managed to squeeze in as best they could. She felt there wasn’t even space for her to breathe. She couldn’t count how many days had passed before the first stop. That day, they were passing the night in a ‘safe house’. After that, they had to continue. She lost track of time and space. She did as she was told. She jumped from one container to another through the journey. In the first part of the journey, she was always starving, but at some point, she completely lost her appetite. Some days, ‘they’ gave them some food, and sometimes they didn’t. She just wanted to get out, breathe and walk. She knew it was not safe. People from the group told stories of their past journeys. It was not the first time. Most women just said it was better inside than outside. After a long journey, S arrived at a border town in Mexico called Reynosa. There, they were all taken to a safeis a country that, over the past years, has faced a lot of internal violence. Organized crime has affected most of the country through the drug cartel’s criminal activities and the fight against them. Besides drug trafficking, these organizations also perpetuate homicides, kidnapping, extortion, human trafficking, etc. Currently, there has been a high increase in ‘murders committed with a firearm in public space against young people’ (Data Cívica 2019). In addition to this, and similar to the countries of Central America, there is impunity in which these activities, especially homicides never get solved and there is no justice (Grillo 2020).Additionally, violence against women has always been a problem in Mexico. Ten women are killed every day on average. Considering the effects of the ‘start on the war on drugs’, murders of women went from 1,089 per year in 2007 (two women per 100,000) to 3,824 in 2019 (almost six women per 100,000). Additionally, according to the National Survey on Discrimination, trans people are perceived as the group that faces the most discrimination in the country (ENADIS, 2017).In this sense, the journey through Mexico is a very difficult one for all people on the move. Unaccompanied minors face different challenges, such as being exposed to criminal organizations or human trafficking, detention, violence, death, exploitation, lack of protection and discrimination. Additionally, it is difficult for them to find basic services like water, food and medicine (UNICEF). Although this is a journey made by many people that can encounter different groups, when traveling alone, unaccompanied minors face loneliness and despair, which affects their mental health. It becomes an uncertain journey, a combination of fear and courage.The Mexican Migration Law of 2011 obliges the National Institute on Migration (INM) to allocate unaccompanied minors to shelters of the National System for Integral Family Development (DIF), which is in charge of providing necessary services to minors. Additionally, according to this law and the General Law on the Rights of Boys, Girls, and Adolescents, minors cannot be detained, and their well-being has to be considered all the time. As in many countries, unfortunately, this does not happen in most of the cases. Minors end up being deported to their countries of origin without the authorities following proper immigration procedures and with a lack of protection (IMUMI 2020, 42).With the ‘surge’ of unaccompanied minors in 2014 in the US, Mexico was encouraged to implement enforcement measures to decrease the number of crossings. Hence, the Programa Frontera Sur was implemented. This program’s objectives were to increase security at different points in Mexico’s southern border and in popular routes throughout the country. In 2014, 21,514 minors were detained. Later, in 2016, this enforcement included controlling the railroad systems and ‘reclaiming ownership’ of La Bestia (Castillo 2016). This year, 31,991 minors were apprehended. Finally, from January to November of 2019, Mexican authorities reported the highest number of minors entering a migratory station: 50,621, of which, 67 percent were deported to their country of origin. In addition to this, the number of children of less than 11 years old increased by 188 percent from 2018 (Manu Ureste 2019).In addition to facing all the dangers mentioned before, there is another risk of confronting gender-based violence. It is estimated that 60 percent of women and girls will be sexually or physically assaulted, or both, in their journey to the US (Acuna 2018). This violence may come from coyotes (smugglers), criminal organizations, authorities or travel companions. Although many take contraceptives knowing what their fate could be, this does not protect them from sexually transmitted diseases and other health risks. Additionally, many of them do not have access to or look for medical care in these situations (Fleury 2016). Additionally, when unaccompanied minors suffer from gender-based violence, they rarely report it to the Mexican authorities. This is because they do not trust them or are afraid of being detained or deported back to their countries (KIND 2017,American Nightmare’F arrived in Tijuana and knew that he had to cross the border, that behind that wall he would be safe. Alone, but safe. He stayed in Tijuana for some days, keeping a low profile because he wanted to be invisible. He was. After a couple of days in a shelter, he met a group of people that had decided to cross. So, they walked towards the border and found a way. They found a hole and crossed. There was a second wall, and they found an open door. Immediately, some agents surrendered them (the border patrol). He told them that he was afraid of going back to Honduras. He was kept in the hielera (cold box). Detained there, he lost track of time, but it felt like an eternity. He didn’t imagine that arriving was going to be this way. He was not able to bathe; he didn’t have a place to sleep. He heard the guards mocking all the kids, telling them they were going to send them back. He felt unsafe again. After that, he was transferred to a shelter, and things were a little bit better. He was able to speak with his uncle. So, after some months of interviews and speaking with a lot of people, he was transferred and able to live with his uncle in Maryland and continue there with his asylum case.S went with a group; the coyote explained the procedure to cross. They encountered Mexican authorities and were detained. She told them that she was fearful of going back home to El Salvador. They didn’t listen. They told her that they were taking her back home. She shouted and cried. She tried to explain that she couldn’t go back, that they were going to kill her if she went back. After some days, she was sent back to the place she feared the most.The process that unaccompanied minors go through when arriving in the US is not easy and can last longer than expected. Amelia Cheatham (2020) explains what an unaccompanied minor has to go through and with which institutions they have to face upon their entry. When arriving, they encounter agents from Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), who are in charge of apprehending, identifying, processing, detaining and, in some cases, deporting the minors. At the beginning of 2020, about 75 percent of unaccompanied minors in federal care were 15 years or older, though younger kids have also been detained. Since September 2018, six children have died in the care of immigration authorities (Cheatham 2020).Before, depending on the children’s nationality, DHS had different protocols. For example, with Mexicans and Canadians, they could be returned to their home countries if it was considered safe. Nevertheless, with other nationalities, like Central Americans, the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) mandates that those ‘identified’ as unaccompanied minors have to be transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) within 72 hours. This is to always look for the best interest of the child and to be completely sure that their asylum claims are well processed (not ending up deporting the children to the dangerous places or situations they are coming from) and properly evaluated for trafficking (Immigration Forum 2018).Once they are in the custody of HHS, the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), is in charge of placing the children in their national network of around 170 state-licensed and federally funded independent facilities that respond to kids’ necessities and basic needs. Children can also be placed in unlicensed temporary shelters, though with the objective that they are transferred from those shelters in less than 90 days. Once the children are placed in these facilities, ORR has the objective to look for the kids’ sponsors within the country; this means parents or close relatives who can prove that can be in charge of the child. In one out of three cases, the agency is not able to find sponsors. Sometimes ORR took care of the children until they were 18 years old, releasing or transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, with some decide to leave the country and most others being deported. In 2019, on average, minors stayed with HHS for around 50 days before their release (Cheatham 2020).transferred to their sponsors does not mean that their asylum cases are over. They have to continue with their processes with immigration courts of the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review. The TVPRA inclines the government to provide legal justice for the minors, though this is not definite. In 2015, just seven percent of the children that appeared in an immigration court by themselves had a chance of winning their cases. If they were represented, their chances increased to 70 percent (Phippen 2015). In the last quarter of 2018, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), part of DHS, granted just over 28 percent of child applicants’ asylum. If they are not given asylum, they could be given another type of legal relief. Finally, in 2019, 71 percent of cases that involved unaccompanied minors ended in deportations. Deportees face violence when they are deported to their home countries, and most do not have a safe place to hide (Cheatham 2020).Currently, the Mexican government has a tougher enforcement strategy. Together with the US government, both have deported more than 32,000 minors from January to August 2019 to Central America, two times more than the same period for 2018. The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), or Remain, in Mexico have also affected thousands of people, including minors. This has left thousands stranded at border towns waiting for their asylum claims in poor conditions (UNICEF USA). As mentioned before, unaccompanied minors that presented themselves at the border alone were supposed to be admitted into the United States. Because of these conditions, some of the parents have been willing to send their children alone. Regardless, nowadays, unaccompanied minors are not allowed to seek asylum in the US. This policy change looks to protect minors from human trafficking.Currently, with COVID-19 challenges for unaccompanied minors have gotten worse. While in Mexico, shelters have become over-crowded, increasing the probability of contagion. Some are still being targeted by criminal organizations, kidnapped or sexually abused (Kriel 2020). Since March 21, 2020, the CBP has deported around 1,000 unaccompanied minors to Mexico. Some have been placed in hotels in the US, waiting to be sent to deportation. Around 460 minors were sent back by Mexico to their countries of origin in Central America. Many others have been apprehended by Mexican authorities in the northern border and sent to shelters (UN News 2020).ConclusionsThe social, economic and political environment that surrounds unaccompanied minors determines their decision to leave looking for survival, for a better future far from their countries of origin, though these same factors and contexts in transit and destination countries also affect their lives. We cannot fail to see that the region is intertwined and that the policies or programs that aim to improve these minors’ lives cannot be made unilaterally. To restrain their right to seek asylum will only have worse consequences on their lives.As we have seen, unaccompanied minors have different vulnerabilities and needs, which does not end with them arriving in the US, if they do. With COVID-19, these have become more urgent and severe. Many of them do not have equal access to services as national children and live in precarious conditions. In the context of COVID-19, for example, they do not have access to public health care (testing, treatment, medicine and mental health resources) or essential or preventive services. This can have negative effects not only on their safety, but also on their chances of having a dignified and good quality of life and in their future. We have to take into account that childhood, adolescence and youth are crucial phases of human development in which there is a transition between dependency in childhood and independence in adulthood. Hence, it is a very important period for a person’s development and can have long-term effects on someone’s life.Successful protection and inclusion policies during this period of their lives help minors and lead them on a path in which they can fully develop in a place that is safe for them. To accomplish this, there need to be actions to protect them, secure access to all basic services and create conditions for a comprehensive development and integration in society. Complete approaches will allow them to develop while safeguarding their human rights, with the positive effect of shaping prosperous, diverse, inclusive and cohesive societies. These policies should be considered, but fundamentally, they have to be applied in Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico and the US to always maintain the best interest of the child. It is imperative to create the conditions in which children and youth can live free of violence and in which they do not have to choose between living under others’ conditions and having to flee for their lives. It is fundamental that they have access to services to fully develop. Likewise, it is imperative that their right to seek asylum is protected and treated carefully and in detail.BibliographyAhmed, Azam. 2019. ‘Women Are Fleeing Death at Home.

Nguyen,Jun 26 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.Since the 1970s, the international movement of people and their labor have become an integral component of labor markets within the developing world. Unsurprisingly, policymakers increasingly view international labor migration as a powerful tool for global development. Both the 2015 Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development make the argument that international labor migration is a ‘win-win-win’ situation not only for the labor-sending and destination countries, but also for the migrant worker her/himself (OECD and ILO 2018). For example, the rapid development of the Gulf states was owed in part to an infusion of foreign workers who made up more than 60 percent of region’s population in 2015 (Rajan 2018). On the other end of the labor corridor, labor emigration is a critical part of the Philippine economy, where remittances make up 10 percent of annual GDP (World Bank 2017b). In addition, for the migrant worker, working in a higher-income country is said to provide a potential pathway for upward mobility for foreign workers and their families.This Global Compact expresses our collective commitment to improving cooperation on international migration. Migration has been part of the human experience throughout history, and we recognize that it is a source of prosperity, innovation and sustainable development in our globalized world, and that these positive impacts can be optimized by improving migration governance. The majority of migrants around the world today travel, live and work in a safe, orderly and regular manner.2018 Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration.Despite this optimism, there is an open acknowledgement among policymakers that the uneven power dynamic between the migrant worker and the governments that regulate their movement and labor creates a context ripe for exploitation. Conventional wisdom says that the best way to protect migrant workers against these the potentials for exploitation is through effective migration management. While what constitutes an ‘effective’ migration management regime might be debated, a principle that often goes uncontested is that the best way to pursue safe migration is to encourage migrant workers to travel through regular channels (i.e., state-sanctioned or state-controlled channels). Encouraging regular migration, the logic argues, better enables states to track and reduce the possibilities of discrimination in terms of wages, working conditions, and housing rights.But who are the actors that make up the regular migration channel? Or, to ask this a different way, who manages migration? Undoubtedly, the image that comes to mind for most is the immigration official or border protection officers who line both sides of the border. While it is true that the state is the final arbiter regarding who gets to cross or stay within their borders, a focus on the state belies the fact that the global labor market is an industry and the cogs that allow it to function are private, for-profit agencies (Ernst Spaan and Hillmann 2013; Surak 2018). These are the actors that occupy a wide variety of roles that enable the global labor market to function. For migrant workers, they are recruiters and guides starting from the first set of paperwork all the way through to immigration in the destination country. Similarly, employers rely on these labor recruitment agencies to not only help them locate potential workers, but also to navigate what is often a complicated labor-recruitment bureaucracy.The purpose of this chapter is to highlight how the increased presence of these for-profit agencies have impacted the migratory experiences of migrant workers. I do so through a comparison of two generations of Indonesian migrant workers along the Indonesia-Malaysia corridor: Bimo, who came to Malaysia in the early 1990s through informal channels, and Gadis, who came in the mid-2000s using state-sanctioned labor agents. Through their stories and based on nine months of fieldwork in Malaysia, this chapter aims to complicate the relationship between regular migration and safe migration by moving away from a state-centric approach to migration management and instead focusing on how migrant workers themselves navigate theMigration Industry: Migration Management and Postcolonial EconomicsInternational Relations’ study of migration management in the twenty-first century draws heavily on James Hollifield’s (2004) concept of the migration state, which pushed the field to recognize the mass movement of people as an integral component of a globalized world. In this increasingly interconnected world, states must be prepared to manage larger flows of migration if they want to continue benefiting from other aspects of globalization, such as freer trade and investment (Hollifield 2004). The studies that followed Hollifield’s seminal work have often privileged the state as the primary actor in migration management (e.g., Adamson 2006; Martin 2014; Peters 2015; 2017; de Haas, Natter, and Vezzoli 2018). These analyses treat different regimes of migration management – be they unilateral (e.g., United States nationalization laws), bilateral (e.g., US-Mexico labor programs) or multilateral (e.g., the Global Compact) – as a function of state interests. In brief, we can better understand the form, content and impact of migration management regimes if we study how state interests are expressed through the bargaining process or as a routinized compliance through the implementation process (Betts 2017).While these studies have expanded our understand of migration management in international relations, I echo a newer generation of scholarship to argue that these dominant approaches have been derived from the historical and political experiences of the advanced industrialized economies in Europe and North America (Adamson, Triadafilopoulos, and Zolberg 2011; Shin 2017; Adamson and Tsourapas 2020). This chapter, instead, shifts the politico-historical focus to a postcolonial context where states’ migration management regimes must work alongside an economic development plan centered on playing ‘catch up’ in the global economy. In these contexts, development not only means an overhaul of the colonial economy, but also often entails creating a labor force that is flexible and inefficient to remain competitive in the face of turbulent global market conditions. This development goal created the context allowing for the infiltration of market-driven logic into the domains of the political and the social, including matters as sensitive to sovereignty as migration management.Fitting with this logic, the day-to-day work of managing migration corridors in post-colonial contexts are often outsourced to what Hernandez-Leon (2008) calls the migration industry, the ‘ensemble of entrepreneurs, businesses and service… motivated by the pursuit of financial gain’ (Hernández-León 2008, 154). Although they are meant to be agents of the state, their primary motivation is neither to protect state sovereignty nor protect migrant safety; their primary goals is to earn a profit by increasing the overall number of people moving across borders. As a result, these labor agencies often have a fraught relationship with the state (Xiang 2012).The Migration Industry along the Indonesia-Malaysia CorridorThe presence of a migration industry has deep roots in the Indonesia-Malaysia corridor. Its origins can be found in late 19th century when hajj became a lucrative business with an intricate network of recruiters, agents, guides, financiers and facilitators operating out of key ports on the islands of Java, Sumatra and the Malaya peninsula (Amrith 2011). Decades later, when the British colonial government encouraged immigration from the Dutch Indies (modern day Indonesia) to grow British Malaya’s labor force (Kaur 2010), Malayan employers relied on recruitment firms that hired Indo-European and Javanese labor agents (werfagenten, ronselaars) to recruit potential emigrants (E. Spaan 1994). A result of this deep history of migration is an extensive communal network built on kinship and hometown ties extending across the Malacca Strait. It is this network that allowed a small stream of Indonesian immigrants to continue trickling into the peninsula long after open migration ended (Wong 2006). The majority of these workers were Muslim and were perceived as bangsa serempun (of the same racial stock) by the Malay majority and, as a result, were seen as a preferred labor source compared to other traditional but more controversial sources, such as Chinese or Indian migrant laborers (LiowStory: The Regularity of IrregularityThe first major shift in the management of Indonesia-Malaysia migration came in the 1970s when Malaysia sustained massive economic growth and undertook large-scale infrastructural and urban development projects (Narayanan and Lai 2005; Kaur 2010). This growth resulted in considerable labor shortages in agriculture, construction, domestic service and – by the 1990s – manufacturing sectors. The earliest (and still the largest) group of foreign workers who filled this labor shortage came from Indonesia, which struggled with high poverty and youth unemployment rates throughout 1970–1990s (World Bank 1981; 1983; Hugo 1993). During this era, Indonesian workers came to the peninsula using networks of kinship and village-level ties, which operated alongside a system of brokers and middlemen to create a chain from the villages in Indonesia to the worksites in Malaysia. This system often began with a calo tenaga kerja (employment broker) who recruited potential workers. Their passage was moderated by taikong laut (sea middlemen), who brought workers to the peninsula by boat, and taikong darat (land middlemen), who had connections with contractors on plantations helping to deliver workers from their landing point to their worksites. For some, this last part of the journey ended when they were handed over to a kepala – an Indonesian group leader appointed by the contractor – who might have been the person started this process by recruiting a trustworthy workforce from his own hometown (E. Spaan 1994).This growth in the number and scope of Indonesian labor to Malaysia pushed the two governments to play a more active role in migration management. For Malaysia, the unregulated inflow of labor had become a ‘problem’ in the eyes of both the Malaysian government and public despite the business community welcoming the infusion of workers coming to meet labor demands. For Indonesia, a controlled outflow of emigration would have enabled the country to alleviate youth unemployment and create a new stream of foreign exchange (Palmer 2016). Negotiations between the two governments resulted in the 1984 Medan Agreement, a bilateral agreement that promoted and legalized labor migration. The agreement, however, was largely ignored by workers and employers alike allowing the number of undocumented workers to grow. When undocumented migration continued to be a ‘problem’, Malaysia, with the help of the Indonesian embassy, began use a combination of amnesty programs and deportation campaigns to control the number of undocumented workers in the country.It was in this first era of migration management, where undocumented migration was the norm and regular migration the exception, that Bimo began his journey.In the early 1990s, Bimo left his home in Central Java at dawn to avoid the Indonesian police, who had started monitoring undocumented labor emigrants. Years later, when he would return to visit over the holidays, the police, knowing that he had left without registering with the local government, would harass him for money (duit rokok). After leaving his home, he and others from his hometown (teman sekampung) caught a bus to Surabaya where a taikong laut was waiting with a boat to take them to Dumai (Sumatra) and then onto the western coast of Malaysia. The journey by boat took one week and cost 800,000 rupiah (437 USD), which he and his family paid by selling off livestock. Others who did not have livestock borrowed money.They were not the first wave of migrant workers from his hometown. Before embarking on his own journey, Bimo knew a multitude of people – friends, neighbor and family members – who had left for Malaysia through unsanctioned channels. In fact, Bimo’s decision to emigrate was based on the recommendation of these early movers. Bimo explained that, for a new migrant worker, it was necessary to have these connections in order to find a good and safeBimo first arrived, he followed a relative (saudara) to work on a construction site. During the day, he stayed in the kongsi (makeshift housing located on construction sites), but at night he and others slept in the forest to avoid police raids. He explained that they were paid not hourly but upon completion of a project. The person who oversaw his work and who paid him was not the contractor who ran the construction site, but the kepala. Because of this structure, if a kepala ran away with the money, he simply would not get paid. This is one of the reasons why it was important to have good connections.A few years into his stay, labor agents came to his kongsi announcing that, for a fee, they could help him get papers through the Malaysian government’s amnesty program. When telling me this story, Bimo laughed, likening them to contemporary labor agents who travel to Indonesian villages ‘looking for customers’. Unlike today, however, Bimo thinks that the smaller number of agents in the 1990s made it easier for foreign workers to figure out who was trying to deceive them and who was being honest. Bimo signed up and received temporary travel papers from the Indonesian embassy. Although he never actually got his employment pass, the temporary travel documents gave Bimo the confidence to move more freely around the country and change employers when he wanted to do so.Gadis’s Story: Regular Migration and the Migration IndustryThe second major shift to the management of Indonesia-Malaysia migration came with the after-effects of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The crisis contributed to historic socio-political transformations of both Malaysia and Indonesia that created the institutional conditions for sweeping changes to migration management in the corridor. In Indonesia, the crisis catalyzed the pro-democracy movement, putting an end to Suharto’s New Order regime, which had ruled the country for more than three decades. The end of the New Order regime also launched a massive decentralization program where political power were increasingly reallocated to provincial and local governments (Caraway, Ford, and Nguyen 2019). In Malaysia, the financial crisis exacerbated the political turmoil within the United Malays National Organization, the political party that has ruled the country since independence. To project an image of strength and capability, the government began a heavy crackdown of ‘illegal immigration’, most notably amending its Immigration Act, to make unsanctioned work by foreign nationals a criminal offense (Ford 2006). The accumulation of these political changes laid the groundwork for the state to bring the migration industry under its control and the control of its sanctioned agencies and away from the taikong and calo. A side effect of state intervention, however, was a maze-like bureaucracy regulating both emigration and immigration.To meet their labor demands, Malaysian employers must confront a complex process where private agencies are built into the system. The process starts at the Ministry of Human Resources, which sets a quota of how many foreign workers employers are permitted to hire. During this part of the process, employers must demonstrate that they have a need for more labor and have done their due diligence attempting to hire local Malaysians. The rest of the process unfolds under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, which approves the quota and issues the Temporary Employment Pass. Working under the Ministry of Home Affairs are also a set of private agencies contracted by the government to issue insurance, security bonds and medical examinations. This is a costly process; most employers cannot navigate this complex bureaucracy without the assistance of a labor recruitment agent. As a former labor agent explained to me: ‘If an employer tries to go directly to Immigration, the officer will say, ‘Why do you do this by yourself? Why don’t you hire an agent?’.[1] He further explained that, because hiring freezes are so commonplace in Malaysia, employers are incentivized to over-ask for foreign workers; if their supply of workers exceeds demand, the employer could then outsource these workers.On the other side of the border, migration management policies in Indonesia became more centralized as Indonesia’s Department of Manpower passed regulations to determine the specific procedures of emigration (recruitment, training, document processing, etc.) (Ford 2006). The massive decentralization of the government in 2002 and the continued pressure from labor recruiters, however, meant that the practice of migration management often lacked coordination across different levels of government (Palmer 2016; Ernst Spaan and van Naerssen 2018). Since 2006, the formal labor emigration market has been controlled by private, for-profit labor recruitment agencies called PT (Perusahaan Jasa Tenaga Kerja Indonesia) that form partnerships with recruitment agencies in host countries (Hernandez-Coss et al. 2008). Although it had become illegal to use a calo, each of these agencies has relied on an army of informal brokers called petugas lapangan who often occupy a wide variety of positions within a community (e.g., teacher, tour guide, salesperson, etc.) to reach out to potential migrant workers (Lindquist 2012; 2015). The PT and the pertugas lapangan are instrumental in the emigration process. Just like it is for employers to hire through regular channels, the current process to migrating through regular channels is costly and burdensome, with 22 separate administrative steps (World Bank 2017a). The petugas lapangan not only help foreign workers navigate this complicated process, but can help them find the money to emigrate. As a result, the vast majority of workers go into debt emigrating, which gets deducted from theircame to Malaysia during the decade following the Asian Financial Crisis when regular migration along the corridor became increasingly common. Gadis was one of the first people from her village (desa) in Central Java to travel abroad for work. During her last year of high school, a teacher gave Gadis a leaflet describing a manufacturing job in Shah Alam (near Kuala Lumpur). The teacher promised her many things – the job would offer a higher wage, free accommodation and the opportunity for her to go to university. Gadis had four younger siblings; her parents were poor and had no formal education. She saw this as an opportunity to improve life for her and her family. Moreover, because this information came from her teacher, she felt that she could trust it.Gadis and a small group of girls from her school decided to sign up. The same teacher helped them fill out the application and gather their first set of documents – parental permission, proof of education and a kartu kuning, which indicated that she was searching for an overseas job. All of this cost her 250,000 rupiah (26 USD). After this, a labor agency came to their school to explain the next steps in the process – they had to make a passport, get their medical screening and so forth. It was still the teacher, however, who continued to help them get through this next stage and accompanied them to Jogja to for their initial medical screening. When Gadis failed her first medical check, the agency gave her specific instructions on how to improve her health.When they all passed their medical exam, Gadis and group of 50 girls from her area were sent to the labor agency’s office in Jogja. They stayed there for three days sharing a single room and two bathrooms sleeping on the floor next to each other ‘like fish’. On the second day, National Agency for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Migration Workers (BNP2TKI), the Indonesian agency tasked with protecting overseas workers, came and told them that, if anything happened to them, they should go to the embassy. On the third night, at around 10:00 pm, the labor agency called them up one by one to sign their contract. When they signed the contract, they agreed to owe the agency a debt of 2,400 ringgit (716 USD). The amount of the payment was for what Gadis called the ‘package’ that included document processing and travel. Until they paid back this debt, the agency kept their national identity card (kartu tanda penduduk) as collateral. After they signed the contract, they gave their passports and other documents. Gadis remembered that it was only then that many of the girls realized that their documents had false information, mainly to make them older and eligible to work abroad. But they had already signed the contract. If they were to back out now, they would still owe the debt. At 5:00 am the next morning, they all left for Kuala Lumpur. The whole process took two months.Gadis’s employer picked them up from the airport and took them to their company-provided dormitories. She worked 12 hours a day, five days a week assembling computer parts for a wage of 450 ringgit (134 USD) per month plus over-time pay for work above eight hours. Every month for the first 10 months, the labor agency came to the dormitory to collect 240 ringgit (71 USD) to pay off the debt she owed. The company warned the girls that if they went too far, they would be arrested. During her time in Malaysia, Gadis left the manufacturing compound only once to go to Kuala Lumpur City Centre – a popular tourist destination in Kuala Lumpur. While there, she was stopped by the police who asked if she was Indonesian. When she said yes, they asked to see herworking there 10 months, the managers called the girls in for a meeting. They told the girls that the company was experiencing issues and had to cut over-time hours. After 13 months, Gadis was down to working only two weeks per month. By the 15th month, the company called the girls in again and gave them two letters. The first explained that the company has decided to terminate their contract and would be giving them one month’s compensation; the second letter was an airline ticket back to Indonesia. She was then deported.The Limits of DocumentsReading these two migration stories side-by-side highlights that maintaining a documented status can sit in tension with pursuing safety. Gadis began her migration journey through an informal broker (petugas lapangan) who led her through the bureaucratic processes that made her a documented worker. Yet, with each step of the process, she became more precarious as she fell further into debt. Besides the few girls from her school, the only relationships she had in Malaysia were made through the company that hired her and the labor agency that sent her to Malaysia. This lack of a social safety net and knowledge of the Malaysian context further skewed the power dynamics between her and her employer. Although she was documented, she had no recourse to voice her grievances when her contract was terminated and she was deported. While Gadis went back to Indonesia after her contract was terminated, it was common for others in her position that remained behind, consequently becoming undocumented, to work and pay the debt incurred through the migration process.In contrast, Bimo relied on communal networks not just to cross the border, but also to find employment in Malaysia. Owing to his status as an undocumented migrant worker, Bimo feared the police, suffered poor working conditions and was a cheated by employers and fellow countrymen. However, unlike documented workers, who must remain with the employer who sponsored them in order to maintain their documented status, Bimo felt no obligation to stay with an employer who mistreated him. Instead, Bimo used this same communal network to leave and find better employment opportunities. When I asked him to reflect on his experience in comparison to the current system controlled by labor agents, Bimo told me:Back then, everything was more open and not so complicated. Before, it was easier to earn money… I felt safer back then. Even though I had no documents, it was just that. Now, even with documents, we are afraid of the agents – they control everything. You have documents, but it is the agents who provide them. You never know if there is something wrong.[2]Implications for the Pursuit of Safe MigrationThere is a consensus across development institutions and policymakers that the pursuit of safe migration necessitates the advocacy of regular migration. This is exactly what Malaysia and Indonesia did. In response to both the demand for labor and the need to portray themselves as protective states, Malaysia and Indonesia have worked to create institutions and mechanisms aimed at ensuring that foreign workers travel through regular channels. Bimo and Gadis’s stories, however, brings our attention to the identities and interests of the actors who line the migration corridors and perform the day-to-day work of migration management. As their stories show, the increasing complexity of the systems, alongside the drive to maintain economic growth, opened the pathway for the entrenchment of the migration industry into the migration process.The intricate relationship between the migration industry, the states’ drive for economic development, and long history of migration between the two countries creates a complex relationship between regular migration and safe migration. To be clear, I am not advocating for nor am I romanticizing undocumented migration. Instead, I want to highlight the drawbacks of regular migration in a context where the migration industry plays a critical role in migration management. Previous studies have shown that simply bringing workers under the purview of the state, particularly one interested in curtailing migrant rights for the sake of economic development, does not necessarily produce safety (Campbell 2018; Bylander 2019). Moreover, the development of a network based on kinship, ethnicity or nationality is a critical component of safe migration as they provide knowledge, care and economic resources to new generations of migrants (e.g., Hagan 1998; Sanders, Nee, and Sernau 2002). Yet, as we saw in Bimo’s and Gadis’s stories, the migration industry can hamper the creation of these networks by making the foreign worker reliant on the labor agents for information on how to survive in a new, strange land. By decoupling safe migration from regular migration, we are able to further discuss alternative notions of safety that not only acknowledge the role of the migration industry, but also foregrounds how migrant workers navigate this landscape.Author’s Fieldnotes, February 2019.[2] Author’s Fieldnotes, March 2019"
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/24/beyond-coloniality-of-internationalism/,Beyond Coloniality of Internationalism,Sabelo J. Ndlovu-Gatsheni,Jun 24 2021,"Envisioning a world beyond global coloniality entails unthinking thinking of today and indeed an epistemic revolution which enables a writing of a different future. According to Hamid Dabashi (2019: 183) Europe and the rest of the world have long ‘‘collapsed on each other’’ and what is urgently needed is ‘a switching off and switching on of a vastly different phantasm of peace from the phantasm of war, rethinking what is dignified from what is dishonourable.’’ How this can be achieved Dabashi (2019: 183) suggests that ‘by first and foremost putting people before war, reality before abstractions, Christians before Christianity, Jews before Judaism, Muslim before Islam, atheists before old and new atheism, agnostics before agnosticism’’ because ‘‘reality has escaped the bastille of abstractions, and the abstract vacuity of their commanding metaphysics has obediently yielded to a vastly different intuition of transcendence.’’ Indeed, we can’t continue to oscillate between the world constructed yesterday for today and the world we wish to create beyond today. We have to rethink and unthink the world beyond the empire, after the empire, more precisely against the resilient metaphysical/cognitive empire, and even more revolutionary, despite the empire.Alas, today, global coloniality masquerades as ‘the international.’ As defined by Ramon Grosfoguel (2007) global coloniality expresses how the modern world’s technologies of subjection shifted from the reality of physical empires to a more complex and invisible hetararchies/entanglements of global power that continue to subject all aspects of human life to it to a Euro-North American-centric world system. This means that the anti-systemic forces which were pushing for a decolonized world were not too successful in delivering a deimperialized, decolonized, deracialized, dehierachized, debourgeoised, and depatriarchized postcolonial and post-racial world (Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2021). Consequently, being human itself has remained socially classified, racially hierarchized and gendered (Wynter 2003; Maldonado-Torres 2007).Nature has remained reduced to a natural resource available for endless capitalist exploitation. Knowledge remains subjected to imperial episteme, data mining, extractivist methodologies, instrumentalization, commodification, and commercialization (all in the service of cognitive needs of global capitalism). Human labour has remained subjected to various exploitative regimes of racial capitalism beginning with enslavement to modern contractual forms (Robinson 1983; Hartman 1997). Human languages continue to be encircled by the six hegemonic ones namely English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese (see Grosfoguel 2011, Ndlovu-Gatsheni 2021a; Ndhlovu and Makalela 2021). However, like all other hegemonic systems, global coloniality has always been contested, resisted and even forced not only to retreat and reconsider some of technologies of subjection but to also make concessions and reforms of the system of domination. As noted by Homi Bhabha (1994), the colonial system together with its colonial discourses while having the hegemonic intention of subjecting all aspects of human life to its power, it was compromised and weakened by the fact that it was never internally coherent and complete, it was always incomplete, ambivalent and internally conflicted; opening itself up to contestations, subversion and resistance.This reality, however, does not diminish the urgency of the call to name correctly what isstudied in International Studies as a colonially constructed ‘‘international’’ with the complicity of elites from the rest of the world. This is why under such a problematic “international,’’ is relentless resistance to any efforts aimed at remaking the world beyond its racial, colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal configurations. Even the celebrated shift from ‘‘empire’’ to ‘‘nation-states’’ amounted to a reshuffling of old cards and this was necessary to enable US hegemony and its global coloniality.The postcolonial new world order of nation-states and perpetuation of global colonialityThe reality which seems to elude International Studies is that the very contemporary institutions, systems and structures underpinning what is masquerading as ‘the international’ are actually out-dated vis-à-vis the unfolding realities on the ground. What exist as a postcolonial new world order was as old as it was new in the sense that it was characterised by continuities within discontinuities. The reality of continuities within discontinuities prompted Mahmood Mamdani (2020: 15) to pose two soul-searching questions: “Why had Europe’s past become our present? Why were nationalist elites reviving the civilizing mission that colonialism had abandoned when it embraced the defense of ‘tradition’?’’one can argue that the struggles for decolonization and their visions of a new world system became hijacked by the forces working in the service of the modern world system. As an emerging superpower, the United States of America (USA) from the time of Woodrow Wilson’s famous post-World War I Fourteen Points of 1919, the Atlantic Charter of 1941, to the United Nations Charter of 1945, it was pushing the agenda of national self-determination not as a progressive decolonization initiative but so as to dismantle the empires which were considered to be a hindrance to the march of US capital across the world (Sharma 2020). The very act of reducing the liberatory horizon of decolonization to attainment of ‘nation-state’ status amounted to the submission of decolonization to the agenda of metropolitan bourgeois capitalists and local petit-and comprador bourgeois capitalist elites of the rest of the world at the expense of the blood and sweat of the peasant and workers who constituted the foot soldiers.It is not, therefore, surprising, that as part of implementation and realization of the postcolonial new world order, the world became even more bordered—a problem which is haunting our contemporary world—because it created what Nandita Sharma (2020) termed ‘‘a people of the place’’ known as ‘natives’ and ‘‘a people out of place’’ called ‘migrants.’Sharma’s correctly critiqued of the postcolonial new world order for not only reproducing but also normalizing “a racism in which political separations and segregations are seen as the natural spatial order of nationally sovereign order’’ (Sharma 2020: 4). Sharma (2020: 4)’s conclusion is therefore very revealing of the continuation of global coloniality under what has been celebrated as the postcolonial new world order in which “nationalism become the governmentality,” the “separation of ‘national subjects’ from Migrants its biopolitics, and ‘national sovereignty’ its leitmotif.”Standing on the shoulders of giants and rethinking the internationalThe reality is that ‘the international’ which embraces humanity with its particularities and pluralities, must not be taken as a given and an existing phenomenon is informed by a deeper analysis of the current constitution, architecture, and configuration of the modern world order. It is also informed by deeper evaluation of the decolonization struggles of the twentieth century and critique of what was delivered as liberation. Taking these critiques together it makes a better sense to think of ‘‘the international’’ as an aspiration so as to avoid embracing global coloniality. The increased and intensified planetary human entanglements enabled by mobilities and migrations and its repopulations of the modern world make this aspiration very important. Achille Mbembe (2019: 13) is correct to posit that the present conjuncture is characterised by “the ongoing redefinition of the human in the framework of a general ecology and henceforth broadened geography, one that is spherical and irreversibly planetary.’’ Therefore, this reality of increased and intensified planetary human entanglements brings into conceptions, understanding and studies of ‘‘the international’’ the pertinent issues of particularities and pluralities. What arises as a result is not only a global governance issue but also an intersubjective challenge within a modern world which is still clinging tenaciously to bounded notions of citizenship and belonging, with the nation-states still existing as containers of out of date subjectivity call ‘‘the national.’’In this thesis of conceiving ‘‘the international’’ as an aspiration, I am not alone. In envisioning a ‘decolonized international’’ which is capable of enabling living harmoniously with difference without anxiety, fear and violence, I am not alone. I am in the company of intellectual giants. In Postcolonial Melancholia (2005) Paul Gilroy grappled with the question of ‘‘living with difference’’ and concluded that even the liberal vision of a ‘‘multicultural society’’ has been ‘‘abandoned at birth’’ because ‘‘multiple anxieties of the ‘war on terror.’’’ Of course, multiculturalism has always been problematic as a solution to what Edward Said (1978) posited as the colonial “law of division’’ and Valentin Y. Mudimbe (1994) termed the ‘‘paradigm of difference.’’The philosopher Souleymane Bachir Diagne (2015) has persuasively and consistently argued that there is no universal that exist, the universal is not behind us so that we can return to it, rather it is ahead of us and we have to strive, struggle and commit ourselves to its invention—beyond what Europe and Eurocentrism laid out. Diagne embraces Immanuel Wallerstein (2006: xii)’s concept of “a more universal universalism,” positing that “The struggle between European universalism and universal universalism is the central ideological struggle of the contemporary world, and its outcome will be a major factor in determining how the future world-system into which we shall be entering in the next twenty-five to fifty years will be structured.’’ He concluded that “If we are to construct a real alternative to the existing world-system, we must find the path to enunciating and institutionalizing universal universalism—the universalism that is possible to achieve, but that will not automatically or inevitably come into realization’’ (Wallerstein 2006: xiii).Of course, others might ask the question of what is the relationship between ‘‘the universal’’ and ‘‘the international’’ and challenge me for conflating the two. There is no ‘‘universal’’ without the ‘‘international’’ and both remain as inextricably intertwined aspirations. The ‘‘international’’ is ‘‘the universal’’ writ small and ‘‘the universal’’ is ‘‘the international’’ writ large. The ‘‘international’’ is the essential prerequisite for what Wallerstein (2006: 84) correctly articulated as ‘‘the universal universalism’’ that is ‘‘a multiplicity of universalisms that would resemble a network of universalfact of the matter is that Europe and later North America in their over five hundred years of domination of the world failed to deliver a “universal universalism.’’ Instead, the poised gift of Europe to the world is global coloniality.This is why Frantz Fanon (1968: 254) openly critiqued and rejected what he termed the ‘‘technique and style of Europe’’ for setting in motion ‘‘negations of man and an avalanche of murders’’ to the extent that it became impossible for human collaboration ‘‘in those tasks which increase the sum total of humanity’’ and ‘‘which demand true inventions.’’ Who then will not appreciate Fanon (1968: 254)’s radical call for radical humanism: “Let us decide not to imitate Europe; let us combine our muscles and our brains in a new direction. Let us try to create the whole man, whom Europe has been incapable of bringing to triumphant birth.”The Fanonian call for radical humanism and indeed radical universalism predicated on what I have depicted as a ‘decolonized international’ was envisioned by Aime Cesaireas far back as in 1956 contained in his letter of resignation from the Communist Party where he laid out an imagined decolonized world as one in which particularisms were not destroyed in the name of universalism—but for a universalism embracing particularisms. Radical universalism is well defined by A. Sivanandan (2018: 7) in terms of being an outcome of struggles of the oppressed not only for themselves but ‘‘for the least of them, the most deprived, the most exploited of them’ […] ‘for a better society for all, and more equal, just, free, a socialist society.’’While some might dispute ‘‘a socialist society’’ as the horizon, Sivanandan’s take on the contents of the struggle for a better world are persuasive and indeed revolutionary.Building of these ideas, the case for continuation with the struggles for a ‘decolonized international’ which Ngugi wa Thiong’o (2012) depicted in terms of ‘globalectics’ where centres of power are decentred and where hierarchies have fallen and there is ‘multi-logue,’ interconnectedness, and equality of potentiality of parts, remains necessary. Some leading decolonial theorists speak about this envisioned “decolonized International’’ in terms of a ‘‘pluriversality’’ (a world within which many worlds co-exist) (Escobar 2017; Reiter 2018). What is emerging here is the courage of scholars to project their utopic registers and escalating them to level of concrete naming of what is envisioned. With the Covid-19 pandemic, the urgency of envisioning a better world—a post-Covid-19 world order has been accentuated.present conjuncture and the ideology of survivorsThe outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic radically challenged our ways of sensing the world, our sense of being in the world, and indeed provoked the existential issues of the future of human beings here on earth. The possibility of pre-mature death became too near to everyone. Inevitably waiting for the vaccine became like waiting for the rains, which give life. It is not only the pandemic that is characterising the present conjuncture—there is also the climate change and the concomitant environmental/ecological crisis (see Chakrabarty 2021). There is linkage between Covid-19 and ecological crisis captured by Dipesh Chakrabarty (2021) in terms of ‘‘emergent object-category of human concern’’ in which there is a collapse of distinction between ‘‘natural and human history’’ because of human action on earth provoking even virulent viruses to seek new hosts in human beings themselves.At another level, the turbulence and turmoil emanating from Covid-19 brought back the state and reignited territorial nationalism as the people looked to the state to lead them in responding to the pandemic and taking steps to save lives. National lockdowns reminded us of being a ‘people of a place’ to borrow a term from Sharma (2020). With no travels allowed at least we forget a bit about the ‘international’ as the ‘national’ focus took hold of our minds. The states became under pressure to prove their capability to protect the citizens from a pandemic or lack of it. Within all this, the question of which group of people were more exposed to the pandemic animated scholarly debates bringing in the long-standing issues of class, gender, race, and even geographical location—with the operations of racial capitalism invoked to make sense of degrees of exposure and vulnerability.To me, what also became ironic is how a ‘pandemic’ could be responded to effectively through ‘national’ solutions rather than ‘international’ initiatives—because there was no doubt that the coronavirus respected no borders and boundaries! Was ‘the International’ not rendered hollow, making the proposition of it as something yet to be born plausible?But what is even more significant is that the pandemic revealed that we are living in a modern world haunted by systemic, institutional, structural and even existential challenges, which in my view have forcibly reopened the basic epistemological and existential questions about the ‘international’ and imaginations of a ‘post-covid-19 world order.’ Perhaps it would make sense to think about a post-Covid-19 world order from the humble perspective of ‘survivors’ of a pandemic who are united in envisioning another world predicated on “the will to live” rather than “the will to power” as well as “economies of care” rather than “economies of profit making.”To realise all, there is need for an epistemic revolution.Beyond imperial episteme: Towards epistemic revolution in rethinking the ‘international’There is increasing consensus that the knowledges which carried the world so far and have plunged us into the present modern and multiple crisis cannon be the same knowledges that take us out of the crisis and into the future. There is urgent need for what Cathrine Odora Hoppers and Howard Richards (2012) termed “rethinking thinking” itself and escalating this to what Immanuel Wallerstein (1999) depicted as “unthinking thinking” as essential prerequisite for an epistemic revolution predicated on the popular slogan of indigenous people’s movement and feminist formations of ‘‘learning to unlearn in order to relearn.’’ This has to begin with the basic epistemic question—what knowledge informs the current constitution, architecture and configuration of the ‘international?’ The basic argument here is thatepistemology frames ontology—knowledge creates reality (Mignolo and Walsh 2018). What the imperial episteme created constitutes the present problematic ‘international.’ The imperial episteme underpinned the hegemonic imperial imaginary which identified the earth empty, available and an object for conquest so as to build what James Blaut (1993) termed the ‘colonizers’ model of the world. The postcolonial world is still haunted by this imaginary. The result has been a very problematic ‘International’ with Europe and North America at the driving seat in pursuit of their relentless ‘‘will to power’’ with the rest of the world being forced to comply.course, the imperial imaginary has always been contested and resisted by such other imaginaries as the Marxist imaginary which identified capitalism as the major problem that needs to be understood, resisted and defeated as it is an embodiment of bourgeois exploitative interests. The proposition was for an ‘international’ created by a proletarian revolution in which means of production were socialized and redistributed equally. However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, this alternative suffered a set back if not ideological defeat but it never died hence it is re-emerging as the “Democratic Marxism of the 21st Century” critical of vanguardism and Stalinism of the 20th century and being very open to embrace other movements such as the environmental, indigenous, feminist and decolonial formations as allies in the struggle for a better world (Williams and Satgar 2013; Ndlovu-Gatsheni and Ndlovu 2021).The democratic Marxism of the 21st century is intersecting with the decolonial imaginary propelled by insurgent and resurgent decolonization of the 21st century (otherwise also known as decoloniality) but constituted by a ‘family’ of epistemic, ideological, ethical, humanist, and political formations ranged against racism, empire, colonialism, capitalism and patriarchy, which are identified as intertwined key problems from which humanity has to be liberated (Ndlovu-Gatsheni and Ndlovu 2021). At its centre are multiple struggles of indigenous people, women, and other formations that continue to suffer from the underside of modernity as well as long-standing demands for a New International Economic Order, Non-Alignment, Pan-Africanism, Tricontinentalism, Black Lives Matter and Rhodes Must Fall movements. The decolonial imaginary is also predicated in what Boaventura de Sousa Santos (2014; 2018) has depicted as “epistemologies of the South,” with the South portrayed as a resisting world rich not only in struggles against racism, enslavement, colonialism, imperialism, capitalism and patriarchy but also visions, which are very critical of ‘coloniality of internationalism.’Conclusion: Towards decolonization of coloniality of InternationalismWhile there is clear evidence that we currently live not only in an epistemically colonized world but also in a colonially ‘regulated world’ in favour of the powerful capitalists, this world order is besieged by contestations, resistance and struggles for change. The basic epistemological and existential questions have reopened. This is why the world of knowledge is in turmoil with universities across the human globe having been turned into sites of struggles. On the air and on the horizon, there are possibilities of an epistemic revolution as an essential prerequisite for the constitution of a ‘new International.’ Whether our generation will rise adequately to this moment is another question which needs urgent attention.The decolonization of ‘the international’, which has a potential to enable an epistemic rupture and indeed propel an epistemic revolution, is one that is not reducible to fighting for national sovereignty symbolised by the ‘nation-state.’ It is one which is multifaceted with a focus on depatriarchization, deimperialization, dehierarchization, deracialization, democratization, and debourgeoisement of the modern world system. This is an urgent agenda. What is promising are the present resurgent and insurgent decolonization of the 21st century embodied by Black Lives Matter Movements and Rhodes Must Fall Movements, portending a postcolonial and post-racial global society in which exclusions predicated on race, gender and other vectors of oppression are transcended. There are indeed epistemic resources that our generation must harness towards decolonizing the ‘international’ and the one which immediately comes to my mind is Edward Said (1978)’s ‘contrapuntal perspective’ which highlights relationality rather than bifurcations. It is predicated on realities of overlapping territories and intertwined histories. The concept underscores what Said rendered as ‘a more urgent sense of interdependence between things.’ This a point which also constitutes Ngugi wa Thiong’o (1986: 108)’s conception of decolonization in terms of “The search for a liberating perspective within which to see ourselves clearly in relationship to ourselves and to other selves in the universe.’’Bhabha, H. 1994.

https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/24/recognition-and-protection-of-environmental-migrants-in-international-law/,Recognition and Protection of Environmental Migrants in International Law,Chiara Scissa,Jun 24 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.It was only in the 1990s that global concerns over environmental changes began to acquire the dimension of a humanitarian issue with massive effects on the well-being and safety of vulnerable populations. In the following decade, international experts and regional bodies provided different regulatory solutions aimed at recognizing and protecting people compelled to flee on environmental and climate grounds. However, these solutions have neither produced an internationally agreed definition of environmental migration nor common assistance and protection arrangements. No groundbreaking policy element was introduced in the international debate on environmental migrants until 2015 with the adoption of the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change. The 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development revitalized interest in and awareness of the causal nexus between environmental threats and migration, then reaffirmed in several United Nations (UN) soft law instruments. Despite this initial policy breakthrough, supported by relevant case law at all levels, the international regulatory process on environmental migration gets jammed again as a consequence of the overall lack of states’ commitment to tackling climate change and granting protection to wider categories of forced migrants.The Urgency of Raising AwarenessHuman migration has always been linked to the environment, but political awareness of the importance of this factor is recent (IOM 2008). Indeed, only in the 1990s did global concerns of environmental changes begin to acquire the dimension of a humanitarian issue with massive effects on the well-being and safety of vulnerable populations. In the following decade, international experts and regional bodies provided different regulatory solutions aimed at recognizing and protecting people compelled to flee on environmental and climate grounds.Still, the international community is far from reaching consensus on the definition to apply to this category of migrants and the protection status to which they should be entitled. Between the end of 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, five proposals to define and assist environmentally displaced people gained particular attention. These were: 1) extending the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees; 2) adding a protocol on climate refugees to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC); 3) adopting a new legal framework; 4) promoting the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement; and 5) using temporary protection mechanisms. However, none of them succeeded in convincing heads of state to process themthe 1951 Refugee ConventionUN Environment Programme researcher Essam El-Hinnawi (1985) first proposed extending refugee status to people compelled to flee from environmental disasters. At the beginning of the 21st century, University of Oxford Professor Norman Myers (2001) supported the extension of the 1951 Refugee Convention to environmental refugees.However, this first proposal has been swiftly dismissed, since few requirements under Article 1A of the 1951 Refugee Convention would potentially be fulfilled by such a category (McAdam 2011). The traditional definition of a ‘refugee’ indeed requires the applicant to be outside the country of their nationality or of habitual residence. Firstly, it has been recognized that most people affected by the environment remain within their country of origin, thus not meeting this preliminary requirement (Nansen Initiative, 3). Secondly, it is difficult to prove the risk of persecution due to climate change or to qualify climate change as an agent of persecution pursuant to the 1951 Refugee Convention. In the well-known Teitiota case, the applicant’s request for asylum in New Zealand was based on the fact that the international community, industrialized countries in particular, failed to limit greenhouse gas emissions, which, according to the claimant, led to drastic climate change effects in Kiribati. However, the High Court of New Zealand noted that ‘there are many decisions rejecting claims by people from Kiribati, Tuvalu, Tonga, Bangladesh, and Fiji on the grounds that the harm feared does not amount to persecution, and there were no differential impacts on the applicants’ (Teitiota v. Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 2015). Thirdly, even if the impacts of climate change could be considered persecutory acts, the 1951 Refugee Convention requires such persecution to be on account of race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership of a social group, while the impacts of climate change are largely indiscriminate, rather than tied to personal characteristics. Therefore, environmental threats and their drastic effects on human rights can be seen as a further reason to issue refugee status, but not the only one.Adding a Protocol on Climate Refugees to the UNFCCCAlthough some scholars (Biermann and Boas 2010), institutions (German Advisory Council on Global Change 2007), and non-governmental organizations (Environmental Justice Foundation 2017) support the use of the term ‘environmental/climate refugees’, they are reluctant to extend the scope of the 1951 Refugee Convention. Utrecht University Professor Frank Bierman, and Wageningen University Professor Ingrid Boas paved the way for an alternative proposal, concerning the establishment of an ad hoc climate refugee convention to be included as a protocol to the UNFCCC. However, they meant to distinguish strictly between climate change and environmental drivers of forced migration, thus impeding their proposal from gaining traction. Indeed, a conceptual and legal distinction between environmental and climate change disasters triggers multiple backlashes. For instance, science has so far not provided for a clear distinction between pure environmental and climate change threats. Even so, states might issue protection statuses more cautiously to the victims of disasters, in order to be sure that the applicant has been affected by pure climate change actions only. This would also lead to more categories and sub-categories of migrants, making efforts to address their vulnerability less efficient.Adopting a New Legal FrameworkAlternatively, other scholars have opted for the creation a new international instrument to protect environmental migrants, as suggested by a Resolution No. 1655/2009 and recommendation No. 1862/2009 of the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Populations together with the Committee on Environment, Agriculture and Regional Affairs of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Other outstanding experts endorsed this third approach. For instance, University of Limoges law specialists proposed to draft a new convention for environmentally displaced persons (Prieur et al. 2008), while Harvard Law School Professors Bonnie Docherty and Tyler Giannini (2009) promoted the establishment of a new, legally binding instrument based on human rights and shared responsibility in order to protect ‘climate change refugees’. They defined a climate change refugee as ‘an individual who is forced to flee his or her home and to relocate temporarily or permanently across a national boundary as the result of sudden or gradual environmental disruption that is consistent with climate change and to which humans more likely than not contributed’ (Docherty and Giannini 2009, 378). In focusing purely on climate change threats, they reproduced the separation already introduced by Biermann and Boas, thus weakening the consistency and pragmatism of theirUniversity of New South Wales Scientia Professor of Law Jane McAdam (2011) has highlighted the reasons why environmental migrants may not benefit from a new international treaty or protocol. According to her, they might address neither their specific needs nor the causes of climate change in different regions around the world, given that climate change affects people differently, and the remedies or anticipatory strategies could diverge. To this end, she argues, local or regional responses would be better able to respond to their exigencies.Promoting the Guiding Principles on Internal DisplacementThe fourth proposal refers to the 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement (United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 1988), a landmark development in the process of establishing a normative framework outlining protection, assistance, and rights for the protection of internally displaced persons (IDPs). However, the Guiding Principles only provide guidelines and lack of legal force. To produce binding obligations, they should be incorporated at the domestic level. For instance, the 2009 African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa (Kampala Convention) embeds relevant principles of international human rights and humanitarian law set out in the 1998 Guiding Principles. The Kampala Convention also explicitly refers to internal displacement due to natural or human-made disasters, including climate change. Moreover, it contains provisions not only for protection and humanitarian assistance for IDPs, but also legal and practical steps to avoid environmental displacement, as well as to provide satisfactory conditions for sustainable return, relocation, and local integration. To date, alas, only 27 out of 55 state parties have ratified the Kampala Convention and few tangible attempts to implement its provisions have been made.An interesting effort to revitalize the Kampala Convention has been made by Narayan Subramanian and Johns Hopkins University Professor Johannes Urpelainen, who use game theory to study when regional treaties are feasible to address cross-border environmental displacement. According to their theory, two states benefit from mutual collaboration when both are affected by environmental threats and, therefore, when they find themselves in a condition of vulnerability (Subramanian and Urpelainen 2013). In their opinion, a regional treaty, such as the Kampala Convention, can provide cooperation and solidarity against a common threat. Nevertheless, when states do not have enough governance capacity to accept environmentally displaced from neighboring states, or are equally affected by climate change, regional treaties may not help either of them.Using Temporary Protection MechanismsThe last proposal concerns temporary protection measures to assist and protect those displaced by environmental events, combined with planned relocation and resettlement programs to reduce the vulnerability of affected populations. At the EU level, several countries have adopted various forms of temporary protection status in their domestic legislations that deal, or could deal, with environmental issues. A 2020 European Migration Network study shows that there are currently 60 national protection statuses, mostly based on humanitarian reasons, which, however, remain largely undefined in national legislation (European Migration Network 2020, 1). This leaves a significant margin of discretion to national authorities in assessing applications owing to environmental drivers.Postponing Commitments: Recognizing Environmental Migration through Soft LawsAlthough relevant, none of the previously mentioned proposals has been met with international consensus. This regulatory and policy limbo leaves a disproportionate number of people to struggle with environmental and climate disasters, exacerbating their vulnerability, poverty, and food and water insecurity. From the beginning of the 21st century, no ground-breaking policy element was introduced in the international debate on environmental migrants until 2015, when the adoption of the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Disasters and Climate Change (Protection Agenda) and the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development revitalized interest in and awareness of the nexus between environmental threats andProtection Agenda encourages states to identify measures for the protection and assistance of transnational disaster-displaced persons. Rather than negotiating a new international agreement, the Protection Agenda stresses the need for states to support the integration of effective practices at national and sub-regional levels into their own normative frameworks in accordance with their specific situations and challenges. In doing so, it seems to be in line with the fifth proposal, namely promoting domestic solutions to environmental migration. In providing a comprehensive, high-quality, and pragmatic legal and policy analysis of environmental migration, the Protection Agenda helps states also by giving effect to the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development, whose aim is to leave no one behind. The latter recognizes that the adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation represent a cause of forced migration. It therefore calls on states to provide adequate solutions to climate change and to protect people affected by it, both within and across their territories.Similarly, the 2016 New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants explicitly identifies environmental disasters as causes of forced migration (par. 1, and 7 of Chapter II in Annex II), and pledges signatory states to address their adverse impacts. The related Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (GCM) also represents a relevant breakthrough, as it is the first ever inter-governmentally negotiated agreement that simultaneously recognizes environmental disasters as drivers of forced migration as well as the urgency to provide protection to their victims (Scissa 2019). Most importantly, the GCM’s Objective 5 calls on participating states to use protection mechanisms ‘based on compassionate, humanitarian, or other considerations for migrants compelled to leave their countries of origin owing to sudden-onset natural disasters’, as well as to devise planned relocation. In doing so, the GCM confirms the environment to be a cause of forced migration, but not of refugee movements. At the same time, the Global Compact on Refugees further stresses this conceptual and regulatory separation, by clearly asserting that environmental threats cannot be seen as valid grounds for the application of the Refugee Convention (Introduction, D8), but rather as an exacerbating factor of forced migration.Despite this initial policy breakthrough, all these innovative UN instruments lack binding force, thus failing to generate strong binding commitments. What is more, several states have refrained from adopting the GCM, thus weakening its potential to foster cooperation in the realm of migration governance. The 2020 Sustainable Development Goals Report notes that only 54 percent of countries have established adequate migration policies to reduce inequalities and vulnerability (United Nations 2020), while feeble actions have been undertaken to tangibly tackle climate change. Remarkably, the last Conference of the Parties (COP25) in Madrid failed to produce common rules for implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement for Climate Change, with which the international community marked its commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on the one hand, and to enhance concerted actions to limit the adverse impacts of climate change on the other. Given that the majority of states are also way off-track to meet the Paris Agreement’s 2° Celsius target, it seems that national, short-term economic and political interests are making states reluctant to deal with two of the biggest challenges of our time. The overall lack of states’ commitment in tackling climate change and in granting protection to wider categories of forced migrants is visible not only at the international level, with the United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, as well as at the EU level, where the negotiation process among member-states on humanitarian visas, common resettlement programs, and an overdue reform of the Common European Asylum System has been in a deadlock for the past five years.Beyond National Interests: States’ Binding ObligationsAs stated elsewhere, the common issue for the protection of environmental migrants should be the official recognition of the issue (Scissa 2019). Jurisprudence, international, and regional binding and non-binding instruments indicate that environmental threats represent both a breach of human rights and a driver of forced migration. They also suggest that states should combine their obligations under international environmental law to those related to international human rights law, as the two issues are inevitably interlinked.Indeed, with regard to law enforcement, the UN Human Rights Council (UN Human Rights Council 2009), the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights (SERAP v. Nigeria 2012), the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 1997), and the European Committee of Social Rights (MFHR v. Greece 2006) found the environment to be a fundamental component of the right to life and health. Additionally, in the Urgenda climate case, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands has recently held that the Dutch government has binding legal obligations to prevent climate change damage, and by implication all governments do as well, under international human rights law (Urgenda Foundation v. the Netherlands 2019). Therefore, the next reasonable step should be to agree internationally on a comprehensive definition of environmental migrants to provide them with adequate protection mechanisms in full compliance with their humanEnvironmental Migrants to Comply with International LawIn light of international human rights law, international customary principles, and international environmental law, states should overcome their attitude of postponement to comply with their international obligations. Environmental degradation, natural and anthropogenic changes in the climate and soil composition, and severe weather events are gravely affecting human rights, such as the rights to life, adequate food and water, health, housing, property, culture, the freedom of movement, and the principle of non-refoulement, among others.In particular, the latter, enshrined in Article 33 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, prevents states from returning individuals to areas where they could face serious harm or where their life could be at risk. It is at the core of international and regional arrangements, as well as of discretional measures aimed at preventing the deportation of an individual whose life and freedom could be in danger. This jus cogens principle is also embedded in in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Article 3), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR, Article 7) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR, Article 3). Most importantly, in the case Teitiota v. New Zealand, the UN Human Rights Committee claimed that if the applicant’s right to life is threatened because of the effects of climate change, s/he cannot be refouled (UN Human Rights Committee 2020).The rights to life and to a healthy environment mutually reinforce one another. Indeed, protecting the environment is indispensable for the full enjoyment of the right to life, health, and an adequate standard of living, while human rights further foster the need of a safe and healthy environment. The right to life does not solely prevent states from deliberately taking life, but also obliges them to take positive measures to properly protect life under their jurisdiction. In this regard, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has recognized that the realization of the right to life is necessarily linked to and dependent on the physical environment (Yakye Axa v. Paraguay 2005). Similarly, the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights found a violation of the right to health and the right to life as a result of displacement from lands in Mauritania, which were confiscated by the government (Malawi African Association v. Mauritania 2000). The opinion that environment and human rights are inextricably linked has been further confirmed by the International Court of Justice Judge Christopher Weeramantry, who has stated that ‘the protection of the environment is… a vital part of… the right to health and the right to life itself’ (Office of the Persecutor International Court of Justice 2016).Furthermore, the UN Commission on the Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights saw the right to water as essential for conducting a dignified life (UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights 2002). According to University of Bologna Professor Marco Borraccetti (2016, 119), the right to water not only corresponds to one of the most fundamental conditions for survival, but is also crucial for the concrete enjoyment and realization of other key human rights, such as an adequate standard of living, food, clothing, and housing.The right to health is enshrined in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and restated in many other international arrangements, such as in Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). At the regional level, neither the European Charter nor the European Social Charter contain provisions related to the right to a healthy environment. However, the European Committee of Social Rights (the Committee) has interpreted Article 11 of the European Social Charter, which specifically refers to the right to the protection of health, as including the right to a healthy environment. The Committee, in fact, found a complementarity between Article 11 of the Social Charter and Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR. Consequently, in several conclusions regarding the right to health, the Committee explicitly stated that the provisions contained in Article 11 of the Social Charter should be duly considered in order to remove the causes of ill health also resulting from environmental threats. In the already mentioned decision on the Marangopoulos case, the Committee identified environmental protection as one of the key elements of the right to health under Article 11. The Committee also affirmed that states are responsible for activities that are harmful to the environment, whether carried out by the public authorities themselves or by a private company. Importantly, Article 16 of the African Charter deals with the right to health, whereas Article 38 of the Arab Charter explicitly recognizes the right to a healthy environment. Furthermore, Article 24 of the African Charter, by including a right to a ‘satisfactory environment’ favorable to development, has been interpreted as the first binding international obligation relating to the right to the environment (Ebekuthe environment and people living therein also leads to the promotion of the right to property as enshrined in Article 17 UDHR, Article 5 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Article 14 of the African Charter, Article 21 of the American Convention on Human Rights, Article 31 of the Arab Charter, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the ECHR. In particular, these instruments affirm that individuals are entitled to peacefully enjoy their possessions. These instruments not only concern the unlawful deprivation, exploitation, and disposition of property, but also encompass the right to land and to land use. While there is currently no explicit reference to a human right to land under international human rights law, several international arrangements consider the enjoyment of land as strictly relevant for the full respect of other recognized human rights, such as the right to food, equality between women and men, the protection and assistance of IDPs, and the rights of indigenous peoples and their relationship with their ancestral lands or territories (UNHCR 2015).Concluding RemarksIt has been no less than 30 years since the debate around environmental migration started flourishing. After two decades, scholars and institutions still refer to the protection of this still blurry category of migrants as an urgent and humanitarian issue to be managed with timely, well-planned responses. Several UN arrangements explicitly recognize environmental migration, but lack of binding force. Conversely, binding instruments that provide protection statuses to environmental migrants, such as the Kampala Convention, are too weakly implemented, while the Paris Agreement does not refer to people affected by climate change. This chapter aimed firstly at summarizing the pros and cons of the most relevant advanced proposals, as well as recent international declarations, stepping up for ensuring protection to environmental migrants. Then, it pointed out that the fulfilment of certain human rights, essential to a dignified life, depends on a healthy and protected environment. Finally, it argued for the urgent need to overcome states’ attitude of postponement in light of their international responsibility to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms."
https://www.e-ir.info/2021/06/23/transnational-governance-as-a-framework-for-migration-control/,Transnational Governance as a Framework for Migration Control,Alma Stankovic,Jun 23 2021,"This is an excerpt from Dignity in Movement: Borders, Bodies and Rights.Get your free download from E-International Relations.It is one of the few undisputed matters in international law that there is no single international migration governance framework (Betts 2011, 2). And with little political impetus at the moment, the prospects to create a global governing regime appear bleak (Laessing and Rinke 2018). What this simplified statement misses, however, is that migration is governed internationally, only not through traditional international legal tools, such as treaties and conventions. Looking closer, there are plenty of formal and informal bilateral agreements governing migration, often with negative impacts on migrants (Partlow and Miroff 2018). Criticisms abound by both scholars and activists about these agreements, especially as they pertain to the human rights of migrants. What goes mostly unreviewed is the development of ‘prevention’ of migration movements as a policy.[1]This development is in part due to transnational law, or transnationalism. Transnationalism was initially developed as a concept during the Cold War to describe the way the East-West divide caused states to be influenced by the domestic developments and presumed interests of other states. Once the Cold War was over, the theory was developed further, predicting that the rise of the ‘regulatory state’ along with its disaggregation into its individual components – executive, legislative, and judiciary – would allow for greater collaboration between different states.The original view was that this type of cooperation would lead to a more ‘just’ world order (Slaughter 2005, 6–7); however, while these networks have become entrenched enough to create a system of governance, it is not as benevolent as initially envisaged. The current system allows immigrant receiving countries (core countries) to exert influence over changes to internal laws and policies of their neighboring, transit, and immigrant-sending countries (periphery countries).In doing so, core countries prevent not only immigration into their own territories, but the entirety of the migration movement. In a sense, they coopt the interests and policies of periphery countries, making them part of the core’s regulatory system and converting them into a semi-periphery.There is no international normative framework of irregular migration governance in the traditional sense of treaties and formal global covenants, but this chapter argues that transnationalism shows that a framework does exist, informal as it may be, and it is used to control migratory patterns. The structure of this chapter is as follows. The next section will briefly define the main premises of transnationalism and its relation to governance, along with their application to irregular migration. Then, it turns to the case study of the United States (US) and Mexico, which provides an example of how this framework actually works and the changes it has produced in migration governance and migratory patterns. Finally, the conclusion briefly summarizes the main points of the argumentsMigration GovernanceTransnationalism is not a new concept. The most prominent advocate for it was Jessup (1956, 52–53), who saw that international norms were bleeding into the traditional domain reservé of states having absolute control over the laws created within their sovereign borders. Scholars of international law after the Cold War asserted that law itself would become transnational, meaning that states would start to harmonize their internal laws as they became more aware of how their own laws may effect cross-boundary interactions. This change would materialize thanks to the development of the regulatory state, where the power to shape internal laws is disaggregated and where policymakers in the executive are as inclined to share notes among their counterparts in other countries as to listen to the other branches of government (Slaughter 2005, 3–6).A subsection of international relations (IR) scholars and policymakers came to the same conclusion: traditional international regimes built on multilateral covenants and treaties were no longer the norm. They attempted not only to understand, but also create new norms and principles underpinning the more regionalized and diverse set of interstate relations in the hopes of streamlining the management of the globalized world. Thus, the concept of global governance was born(Betts 2011, 4).In combination, these two concepts became the underpinning of the current approach to managing a variety of transnational fields. Migration, being a cross-border phenomenon by nature, falls within the scope transnational governance, with bordering countries establishing rules not just on how to treat each other’s citizens’ movements across the border, but also those of other nations (The Schengen Acquis 2020).Indeed, the control of entry of those falling outside the ‘desired’ class of immigrants, so-called irregular migrants, has become the most predominant ‘worry’ of policymakers in core countries. As a result, they have turned to transnational governance tools to ensure that their neighbors stop irregular migrants long before they reach their borders.Transnational Governance DefinedThe first time transnational law was used to describe cross-border matters was in 1955 by Jessup, who coined the term. Jessup’s (1956, 3) main position was that the traditional dichotomy of domestic and international law cannot hold in the realities of the Cold War world. The key issue was that the distinction was not necessary, as jurisdiction in the classical Westphalian sense of territorial sovereignty was no longer exclusive under ‘modern’ international law, since concepts such as human rights limit the exercise of state power even internally (Jessup 1956, 36, 39–41). For Jessup (1956, 30), this was proof that domestic law had developed beyond its traditional role, having ‘taken account of the new social consciousness’.Keohane and Nye (1974, 40–41) developed this idea further and posited that transnational interactions have become increasingly significant and as a result sensitize nations to each other. Specifically, as the world was becoming more interconnected, governments would have to start designing policies and rules that are sensitive to those of other states, since any attempts to regulate, encourage, or disrupt the private cross-border interactions within one nation’s borders would have an impact on the citizenry of another state (Keohane and Nye 1974, 41–42). In their view, these sensibilities encourage more transgovernmental interaction among the bureaucracies of the respective states, causing potential for greater convergence between their laws and policies (Keohane and Nye 1974, 42).This idea of harmonization was taken further after the end of the Cold War. Slaughter (2005, 10–11) argued in her seminal work, A New World Order, that states were no longer unitary actors who control the international sphere; rather, it is a web of formal and informal transnational networks of individual ‘components’ of a state that now determines interactions between states (Slaughter 2005, 10–11). For Slaughter, this was a positive development for two reasons. For one, it solves the legitimacy problems that would occur under a world government (Slaughter 2005, 7). The other benefit is that these networks would foster problem-solving through three main functions: (1) creating convergences by facilitating a ‘regulatory exportation’ of best practices and norms from one country to another (information networks), (2) improving compliance with international norms through information sharing and capacity building (enforcement networks), and (3) increasing international cooperation by transferring regulatory rules from the domestic to the international sphere (harmonization networks) (Slaughter 2005, 19–20, 23–24). This harmonization would foster cooperation on a global level, replacing traditional multilateral internationalthis same time, IR theorists also sought to understand how the international order was changing, naming their studies global governance. The term eschews a fixed definition, with various scholars having similar yet differing views on what it actually means (Betts 2011, 3–4; Rosenau 1995, 14; Weiss 2009). Looking at their commonalities, one can understand global governance as the sum of all supra-national regulation, cooperation, and organization of the normally present ‘anarchy’ in the international sphere, these actions being pursued and achieved by a variety of actors forming and instituting rules, norms, and policies that govern behavior. In essence, governance is the result of the lack of an overarching world government structure and is nevertheless a means to achieve cooperation on matters that a single state cannot manage on its own due to territorial limitations.The key concept for both governance and transnationalism is the drive towards multilateral cooperation in the international sphere (Rosenau 1995, 13). Governance theories argue that, to ensure effective governance, transnational networks should be used to influence the results of global policies.[2] This idea is synonymous with the horizontal networks of transnationalism, where networks transport best-practices and enforcement of agreed-upon rules and laws across borders, which can assist in creating coherent systems of governance for cross-border concerns. Hence, transnational governance then can be defined as the summation of the two concepts. It is the conglomeration of regulations and cooperation across national borders (the governance component) through horizontal networks, whose aim is to harmonize practices and laws to achieve a particular result (the transnational component).Transnational Governance of Irregular Migration ReviewedHuman history has been marked by migration. However, the desire to systematically control migration, especially ‘irregular migration’, is relatively recent (Triandafyllidou 2016, 33). But who is an irregular migrant? There is no officially accepted definition of that term. Moreover, the definition has become muddled due to a variety of misuses. To really understand irregular migration, one must understand how it is formed. According to Crépeau (2013, 2; 2018), irregular migration results from a combination of three factors: (1) the unrecognized labor needs in destination countries, where there is an incentive to ‘profit from [the irregular migrants’] vulnerability… [with] little political appetite to repress this, since this could cost jobs and taxes in low profit-margin sectors’; (2) the emigration needs in home countries, such as high unemployment rates or remittance dependence; and (3) the lack of legal avenues for migrants to enter destination countries.This disconnect between the different economic needs of sending and receiving countries and restrictive immigration laws is crucial in creating the phenomenon of irregular migration. Most immigration laws and policies are designed with the alleged economic benefit an immigrant brings, with preference given to ‘highly skilled’ immigrants. However, the unacknowledged need for cheap, unskilled labor means there is an economic benefit of those immigrants as well. Moreover, the economic benefit to sending countries of unburdening themselves of a large un- or underemployed workforce is significant, but is rarely considered in the creation of immigration rules by the destination country. Essentially, without the means to enter legally, those who fill these economic needs are labeled irregular migrants.Applying the transnational governance definition to irregular migration, such governance is the formal and informal collaborations and cooperation among core countries and their neighboring periphery countries with the goal of containing, diverting, or preventing migration movements to ensure that the above noted economic needs are still met. To do so, core countries have developed a variety of tools and methods, especially as regards the externalization of migration control. The European Union (EU) is one of the most prominent examples of such externalization. From the European Neighborhood Policy to readmission agreements, the EU actively seeks to control immigration into its territory by negotiating rules on what its neighboring countries do with migrants who transverse their countries (Triandafyllidou and Dimitriadi 2014, 11). But more informal collaborations exist as well. For example, the EU Border and Coastal Guard Agency has cooperated with Moroccan authorities regularly on border surveillance and policing, which allows Morocco to stop certain migrants in transit, preventing their reaching the EU (Carrera 2016, 7–10; den Hertog 2017, 3–4,key tools to effect these policies are deterrence and regionalization. Deterrence takes many forms, from making immigration and other domestic laws more restrictive and transgressions thereof punitive to increasing military/police presence on borders. Regionalization seems more benign in comparison, with development aid and repatriation assistance often used as tools to ensure such returns. Yet, there is also a darker side of regionalization, namely the argument that its true goal is not assistance, but containment (Crépeau 2018). Both of these tools contribute to the denial of human rights, which is why a significant amount of current literature reviewing irregular migration governance focuses on that issue (e.g., Gammeltoft-Hansen 2011; Mann 2016; Hesch 2018). Some, like Mann (2013, 316), argue directly that the existence of the transnational migration governance networks undermines the multilateral human rights regime. Nevertheless, in many cases, the boundaries of irregular migrants and refugees are blurred, and the academic focus tends to center on the latter and their situations in periphery countries (Gammeltoft-Hansen 2011).Given its well-established externalization policies, the EU has been one of the most studied examples. Australia’s harsh rules on dealing with asylum seekers by placing them in detention on an island outside its borders is another prominent example (e.g., Nethery, Rafferty-Brown, and Taylor 2013) Also, the US’s detention of migrants and refugees has a long history of academic review from various perspectives (e.g., Motomura 1999). Though more recent projects have been developed that attempt to collect and study data on the impact of immigration regulations on migration movements in their entirety, few authors consider the effect on the movement as a whole or the changes within the periphery countries.[3] This is not a coincidence. Given the high level of informal collaborations, it is neither easy to collect the necessary data nor is it easy to make the connections.The United States-Mexico Case StudyThe US-Mexico migration patterns have traditionally moved from south to north, from Mexico to the US. Therefore, migration control, as well as scholarly and policy concern, has traditionally been an issue of US immigration control. Mexico, in contrast, had no formulated migration policy for most of the 20th century. Its main focus was on the emigration of its own citizens, which since World War II benefitted the country twofold: one, it relieved the economic pressure of having a large un- or underemployed workforce, and two, the remittances sent home allowed the Mexican economy to maintain some stability. (Zong and Batalova 2018; Gillespie 2018)Thanks in part to the 2008 financial crisis, this south-to-north emigration trend has slowed, (Zong and Batalova 2018); in the years immediately after the crisis, there was a net deficit of Mexicans arriving in the US (Gonzalez-Barrera, 2015). Nevertheless, the overall immigration rate into the US has continued rising in large part due to an increase of migrants of other nationalities (Passel and D’vera 2015). Hondurans, Salvadorans, and Guatemalans fleeing violence and poverty have entered and traversed Mexico since the 1960s and 1970s, but they started to do so in even greater numbers in the 1990s and 2000s. As the US increased its entry restriction, Mexico became more of an immigrant receiving country. Consequently, it started to develop its own migration policies and laws. Some of these changes had a positive effect, such as the decriminalization of irregular migrants and the adoption of a wide-reaching refugee definition. Others were much more concerned with allowing for greater migration control.This latter development was not unaided by the US. Having a significant interest in stopping or at least containing migrants from the south, the US government has exercised a certain amount of influence over Mexico’s policies. The most conspicuous type of influence has been the technical support provided by the US in terms of trainings and equipment to allow for greater cooperation on the US-Mexico border. However, financial assistance was also provided for increasing migration control on Mexico’s southern border. As a result, much of Mexico’s migration actions, especially those exercised on the southern border, appear to be almost identical to those the US uses on its border with Mexico, so extending the reach of the US migration control efforts.A Brief History of Migration Control Measures by the USFor the most part, the relationship between Mexico and the US was marked by immigration control imposed by the US, and while there were certain positive (Ngai 2004, 138-139) and negative (Ngai 2004, 71-73; Koch 2006) policies throughout the 20th century, the general migratory pattern was a circular one, with mostly Mexican labor moving to the US as needed and leaving or being deported when not (Blakemore 2018).With public perception growing increasingly negative towards immigrants, the US instituted rigorous immigration controls starting in the 1980s, which had a lasting effect. In 1986, the US Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA), which imposed, inter alia, high requirements for futureeffects were entrenched in the 1990s, when Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA). The IIRIRA was responsible for creating a more structured set of rules to increase the efficiency of border patrol efforts and immigration court proceedings. It also introduced the concept of unlawful presence and criminal penalties for it, along with an expansion of who would be deportable (Lundstrom 2013, 389, 395; Abrego, Coleman, Martínez, Menjívar, and Slack 2017, 697). Most importantly, it also provided the US government with two main methods by which persons are apprehended for deportation: ‘employment raids and cooperation with local law enforcement’ (Stankovic 2018). The latter practice has particularly increased since 9/11 (Juárez, Gómez-Aguiñaga, Bettez 2018, 75–77); the former took on a particularly aggressive form under the Trump administration (Mazzei 2018; Sacchetti 2018). Together with a proliferation of security measures at ports of entry and the increased militarization of the southern US border and the increased detention migrants in the US, these new rules allowed the US to better achieve its main migration control goal: deterrence (Brown 2018).The militarization of the border has not only increased the presence of border officials but has – thanks to technological advances, internal support by the military, and external capacity building networks – increased their functional capabilities. With immigration seen a threat to national security, the power of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has also been extended in the legal sphere. Through such concepts as ‘expedited removal’, CBP agents today can turn away persons ‘within 100 miles of the boundary, [with] the discretion to remove unauthorized persons from the country without any formal legal or administrative process at all, in some cases with a record of formal deportation’ (Heyman and Campbell 2012, 88). The Trump administration increased the use of expedited removals and instituted harsh new rules, such as family separation and the Remain in Mexico policy, in its attempt to further stifle immigration.[4] All these developments had a domino effect, with Mexico needing to adapt new rules for its own territory as a result.US-Mexico Migration GovernanceCollaborations between the US and Mexico and their Influences on Mexican Border Control MeasuresFor Mexico, migration control has not traditionally been a major concern, (Alba and Castillo 2012, 3) as it saw itself primarily as an emigrant country (Fitzgerald 2009, 55–56). Emigration was a benefit, as it provided a means of lowering economic pressures by having a good portion of the workforce emigrate instead of being present in the depressed labor market (Fitzgerald 2009, 55–56; Alba 2013). In addition, remittance funds sent back home also alleviated pressures on the social system (Alba 2013; Gillespie 2018). Consequently, Mexico had little to no official migration policies in place during the early- and mid-20th century. Change came once the US started restricting its immigration policies in the 1980s and 1990s. Suddenly, Mexico did become interested in migration control – though initially mostly concerned with its citizens’ free movement (Baker 2011, 8–11; O’Neil 2003). Efforts to establish some formal multilateral agreements on this issue (Schmitt 2001), however, failed to take off after the US abandoned immigration reform in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 (Waslin 2003, 2; Bueno Pedraza 2005, 600–601; Gutiérrez 2007, 71–72).This does not mean that no collaborations were made on migration post-9/11. One such attempt was the so-called Smart Border Agreement (Sullivan 2002). The agreement was ostensibly geared towards regulating and securing the movement of people across the US-Mexico border (Silva Quiroz 2014, 48) with a particular goal being the development of more coordinated information-sharing. But there was already an external aspect to the agreement: it called for increased cooperation in identifying persons who could pose a threat before they entered either territory, for the development of technological systems at ports of entry to streamline (and monitor) entries and exists, and for the coordination of efforts to prevent the human trafficking of third-country nationals (Silva Quiroz 2014, 48–49). This combined approach implied that the US and Mexico both shared the same interest in keeping othersthe US side, the Smart Border Agreement meant a hefty increase in funding for personnel and technology for the relevant enforcement agencies; for Mexico, the agreement’s objectives were imported into its Plan Sur (Silva Quiroz 2014, 48-49). Plan Sur’s purpose was essentially to increase control of the migratory movements from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to the southern Mexican border, specifically by focusing on increased inspections of migrants’ documentation and greater inter-institutional cooperation in halting smugglers (Silva Quiroz 2014, 49; Gonzalez-Murphy 2013, 60). To do so, the government established two lines of checkpoints, one covering the states of Chiapas and Tabasco and one covering the states of Veracruz and Oaxaca, increasing personnel and essentially starting a militarization of Mexico’s southern border similar to what had taken place in the US a decade earlier (Gonzalez-Murphy 2013, 60).The most prominent effort, however, was the Mérida Initiative. Intended to deal with the illegal weapons and drug trade between the two countries (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 9; Olson 2017, 3–4), the US provided equipment for purchase for the Mexican police and military in the amount of almost $600 million along with technical assistance and training for Mexican forces (Evolution of Mérida 2018).[5] Under President Obama, the initiative was expanded to include other concerns, such as migration. This expansion was one of the main US efforts to contain and deter Central American migration, and also the best means to export its immigration policies to and secure the collaboration of Mexico.One way of doing so was to emphasize the concept of security (Beer 2015; Pope 2016). While Mexico changed its laws to allow for greater collaboration at the US-Mexico border (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 19–20), the US also spent significant funds under the Mérida Initiative on Mexico’s southern border. During the Obama administration, over $2.6 billion was appropriated by Congress for Mexico’s southern border (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 11–12; Knippen, Boggs, and Meyer 2015, 16). The measure remains popular in Congress, which continues to appropriate funds for the program (Sieff and Sheridan 2018).But there were also less informal means of cooperation, under which US resources were appropriated to assist migration control on the territory of its southern neighbor. One set of such cooperations came directly from the US immigration authorities as early as the 1990s. Under ‘Operation Global Reach’, the US appropriated over $8 million for the opening of Immigration and Naturalization (INS) offices extraterritorially in Mexico and other Central American countries (Flynn 2002, 29–30; Koslowski 2011, 69). From these offices, INS agents trained host-country agents, participated in ‘special operations to test various illegal migrant deterrence methods in source and transit countries’, and accompanied ‘local authorities to restaurants, hotels, border crossings, checkpoints, and airports to help identify suspicious travelers’ (Flynn 2002, 30).Another line of informal cooperation is military-to-military assistance (Olson 2017, 20–21). Similar to how civilian law enforcement in the US provided equipment and training to their Mexican counterparts, the US Department of Defense (DOD) has provided the same services to the Mexican military, including training in the US (Olson 2017, 20–21). Officially, more than $9.8 million in assistance was given to Mexico between 2008 and 2016 (Olson 2017, 33).[6] Additional funding for DOD assistance to Mexico was funneled through the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing program, where a total of $463 million was used in the same time period for similar activities (Olson 2017, 33).[7]These more informal means are particularly valued by the relevant executive agents. From 2006 through 2012, Mexico’s efforts to develop a common vision of responsibility between the two countries has resulted in more institutional and informal channels of dialogue and cooperation (Libro Blanco 2012, 5). Such dialogue and cooperation is evident in the plans and declarations made by the two countries. Between 2004 and 2012, 16 declarations were made by the governing executives of the two countries on issues of migration, mobility, and security, along with three relevant plans of actions (Libro Blanco 2012, 10–11). An additional 30 memoranda, agreements, declarations, and plans of actions were made between 2013 and 2018 (Libro Blanco 2018,Changing PoliciesThe violent political upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s in Central America affected Mexico greatly (Castillo 2002, 40–41). Many refugees from the region found themselves on the Mexican side of the border because of the indiscriminate violence in their home countries (Castillo 2002, 40–41; Alba and Castillo 2012, 4–5). With the US increasingly trying to restrict entry into its own territory, Mexico suddenly found that it was no longer only an emigration country. For most of the 1980s and 1990s, however, Mexico’s migration policy was rather incoherent (Castillo 2002, 42; Alba and Castillo 2012, 6). Nevertheless, there was a distinct strategy of containment and deportation of migrants crossing its southern border. This strategy was implemented by increasing requirements Mexico started putting on those seeking entry (Alba and Castillo 2012, 5), but it also developed because Mexico’s immigration laws consisted of only the provisions in the 1974 Ley General de Población, which criminalized irregular immigration.[8] With the requirement that transiting passengers have an entry visa for their final destination – a requirement partially the result of US pressures (Alba and Castillo 2012, 5) – meant that virtually any migrant from Central America would be labeled a criminal.Due to migrants increasingly entering clandestinely, Mexico’s policy started taking greater shape in the 2000s. Two plans were initially developed to contain immigrant and transit migrant flows: the Sellamiento de la Frontera Sur program and the above-mentioned Plan Sur (Alvarado Fernandez 2006, 74). Both plans were seen as means to appease the US and to allow the favoring of Mexicans entering the US (Flynn 2002, 32; Galemba 2015). These plans resulted in a multitude of ‘control operations and mechanisms [that] were implemented at strategic points… particularly along the highway routes migrants and their guides favor[ed]’ (Castillo 2006).A complex web of immigration, law enforcement, and military officials engaged in verification and control activities at these checkpoints (Isaacson, Meyer, and Morales 2014, 27). These new developments were welcomed by the US, where it was noted that the Mexican government was finally doing something about the ‘migrant problem’ (Flynn 2002, 34).Deportation, often euphemistically labeled repatriation, also became a more common tool. Under Plan Sur, Mexico deported Guatemalans back to their own country by bussing them directly to their home authorities; it also deported non-nationals to Guatemala if it determined that they entered Mexico through that country (Flynn 2002, 29). The costs for the deportations were covered in large part by the US (Flynn 2002, 29). In 2003, Plan Sur was superseded by the Fortalecimiento de las Delegaciones Regionales de la Frontera Sur program, whose aim was, inter alia, to increase control over migration movements and to establish repatriation agreements with Central American countries. One such agreement, akin to the EU’s readmission agreements, had already been signed with Guatemala in 2002 and is renewed regularly (Alvarado Fernandez 2006, 74). Under that agreement, persons found to be in Mexico without permission would be deported to Guatemala; it was then left to Guatemala to further deport those persons who were not nationals (Castillo 2006). In 2006, a regional agreement was signed between Mexico and several of its southern neighbors with similar provisions.On the legislative side, Mexico also became more active. As the US increased border controls, it created pressure on Mexican communities throughout the country. Interestingly, at least on paper, this pressure did not mean a greater restriction as it had in the US. Seeking a greater role in regional cooperation generally (Alba and Castillo 2012, 9–10), Mexico amended the Ley General de Población in 2008, to decriminalize irregular immigration into the country. Shortly thereafter, in 2011, an extensive new legal regime was adopted, dealing with refugee and subsidiary protections. In the same year, the legislature also passed a sweeping new immigration law, the Ley de Migración.Several aspects of the immigration law seem to give migrants broad rights. For example, Article 7 notes that all persons have the freedom to transit Mexico without having to prove their nationality or migration status, save when requested by competent authorities as permitted by the law specifically. It is also especially insightful that the law makes provisions regarding transit migrants in minute detail. Some of these are quite revolutionary when compared to the laws in the US: in Mexico, transit migrants presented to the immigration authorities have a right to legal assistance and must be informed of the possibility to regularize their entry into Mexico.Within the law, however, there are also provisions that create tension with this apparent human rights approach. Under Articles 66 through 68, the Mexican state reserves the right to detain and deport irregular migrants and to notify their own countries of their presence in Mexico to safeguard its own sovereignty. This tension is also evident in the practical application of the law. Critics were worried from the outset that in the heightened security atmosphere at the time, retraining the staff implementing the law could prove challenging. (Alba and Castillo 2012, 17–18). Also, the process has been burdened due to the overlapping deployment of different agencies together with the Instituto Nacional de Migración (INM) to enforce the law (Isaacson, Meyer, and Morales 2014, 10–11). Moreover, it has also been marred through corruption and criminality concerns (Isaacson, Meyer, and Morales 2014, 17; Knippen, Boggs, and Meyer 2015, 22; Nolen 2016).Most importantly, the execution of the law was still influenced by US-desired policies. When an unprecedented number of unaccompanied minors made their way through Mexico and across the northern border in 2013 and 2014, Mexico, at the urging of the Obama administration, increased the presence of border control forces, checkpoints, and detentions along Mexico’s border with Guatemala and Belize (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 21; Castillo 2016, 2). Part of the Programa Frontera Sur, these stronger controls were installed at 12 points of entry into the country and along three corridors stretching across 100 miles of Mexico’s southern border, and more boots on the ground were put in place by including INM officials, making checks alongside federal and local police (Mexico Enforcement Efforts 2016, 1). This maneuver allowed the government to create over 100 mobile checkpoints (Mexico Enforcement Efforts 2016, 1). Little surprise that these increased control measures resulted in far higher numbers of apprehensions, detentions, and deportations, mirroring US policies (Castillo 2016, 3-4; Mexico Enforcement Efforts 2016, 1; Arriola Vega 2017, 16–17; Holman 2017).These efforts could not have been done without US assistance. The details of US aid do not tend to be divulged too publicly (Matalon 2016; Olson 2017, 6–7; Arriola Vega 2017, 13). What is known is that the US appropriated $100 million for border security equipment and training alone (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 15). In addition, in 2015 the US invested $75 million ‘to help Mexico develop an automated, interagency biometrics system to help agencies collect, store, and share information on criminals and migrants’, and an additional $75 million was appropriated in 2016 ‘to improve secure communication capabilities among Mexican agencies working in eight southern states’ (Ribando Seelke and Finklea 2017, 15). Even more crucially, the US has actively assisted Mexico in strengthening its documentation checks, allegedly sending its own officers to the southern border to help their Mexican colleagues in identifying migrants who had been previously deported (Matalon 2016). This assistance seems unsurprising given that some US officials at the time considered the Mexico-Guatemala border ‘our southern border’ (Miller 2014, 200).[9]Far from being appalled at the Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants in the US – and the anti-Mexican rhetoric tied to those policies – the Mexican government under the López Obrador administration has continued its collaboration with the US. Whether it was Mexico’s agreement to the US’s Remain in Mexico policy on its northern border or the deployment of the National Guard to stifle migration flows on both borders, the López Obrador administration seems to continue to apply strategies according to US pressures (Rivers 2020). Even its new human rights-oriented laws appear to be overlooked by authorities. Human rights non-governmental organizations argue that the López Obrador administration treats migrants as abhorrently as the Trump administration (Vivanco 2020). Further, most Central American migrants are shuffled into the Mexican immigration system via the so-called humanitarian visa. Ostensibly, the visa is a positive tool, as it gives immigrants the right to remain and even work in Mexico. However, the visa’s duration only lasts one year, and its renewal is usually not assured (Vonk 2019). Moreover, the receipt of the humanitarian visa prevents qualified migrants from applying for any human rights-related statuses, such as refugee status (Vonk 2019).is no international normative framework for irregular migration – but that does not mean no one controls irregular migration. Core countries, those receiving immigrants, tend to be the ones setting the rules not just when it comes to their own immigration laws, but also when it comes to laws and policies affecting their neighbors. This influence is often transmitted through horizontal networks between state agencies by providing funding and capacity-building support. To be clear, the influence of core countries is not the sole reason why periphery countries change their national rules on migration. Moreover, a reluctance by periphery countries’ leaders to admit to the core’s influence for internal political reasons also muddies the water and prevents a clear cause-and-effect line to be drawn. Still, there is a palpable effect of influence from core countries that can best be explained through the concept of transnational governance.The US and Mexico form a prime example of the influence a core country can exert on its peripheral neighbor. Internal changes in US laws and greater cooperation on the US-Mexico border have increased the relevance of such cooperation and funding to be applied to Mexico’s southern border. Moreover, these collaborations and cooperations precipitated internal legal and policy changes in Mexico, which support the rights of migrants on paper, but follow the same restrictive notions of US policies in practice. Far from being an emigrant country only concerned with how the northern neighbor treats Mexican citizens, Mexico has become a transit and immigration country with a new migration law on the books. Its migration policy has developed alongside these collaborations and has the same goals as in the US: deterrence and containment. This change is not unusual when realizing that transnational governance methods are imbued with power imbalances that favor core countries. Still, it is somewhat astounding that peripheral countries adopts the same viewpoint as quickly as they have; leading to the conclusion that Mexico is slowly shifting its position and is becoming part of the core.From a transnational governance perspective, this seems a success story: the system works as intended. Information-sharing, capacity-building, and ultimately transnational harmonization – all of the elements are present and provide a viable governance system of a transnational phenomenon. The question remains of course whether the system in place is one we want to have."

In many different country contexts, there are increasingly more recognized definitions of discrimination based on, for instance, class, gender or race. However, discrimination based on non-native accent is not one of those widely accepted categories of discrimination. In fact, accent is considered something that a person can change almost effortlessly if s/he has the will to do so, and thus, it is seen as different from other characteristics, such as race or gender, which admittedly cannot be changed. According to this rationale, the fact that you speak another language with an accent signals incompetence and lack of effort. If you are not changing, an aspect about you (accented speech) that you are capable of changing, differential treatment against you cannot be discrimination, the logic goes. Therefore, it gives employers, public officials, teachers and native speakers reason to treat you differently from those who speak ‘without an accent’.Accent refers to the phonological characteristics of speech. In that sense, everyone has an accent (Matsuda 1991). There are accents that are geographically or class-determined, and other accents are caused by the transfer of the phonological features of the native language to a second language. This second one is called an L2 accent (Derwing et al. 2014, 65), while L1 accent refers to the native variety of a language. This paper is about the non-native accent or L2 accent, which is an issue that has so far been especially discussed by linguists and researchers of education. While this chapter benefits from the contributions of these two groups of researchers on the subject, it mainly aims to make a sociological contribution to debates on accent by focusing on discrimination based on non-native accent. Although discrimination has been a well-researched sociological subject in general, it has especially been studied with reference to such categories as class, race and gender. Discrimination based on non-native accent remains a largely under-researched area for sociologists.This chapter will start with a linguistic discussion on accent and non-native/L2 accent, and will then tie these discussions to a more sociological debate on how non-native accent can be a basis for stigma, how people make judgements about others based on non-native accent and what non-native accent discrimination implies especially in the context of the United States. The following section will first give information about the empirical research, where we conducted semi-structured interviews with 40 highly skilled Turkish migrants who left Turkey as adults with at least undergraduate degrees to have further degrees or professional careers in the US and returned back to Turkey after living in the US for at least five years. In this section, there will also be a discussion of the experiences of our respondents as non-native speakers of English during their stay in the US. This section will emphasize that, although they had left Turkey with certified proficiency in English, their everyday life in the US was largely shaped by the fact that they had non-native accents. Although the respondents did not name their difficulties related to accent as discrimination, depending on their accounts, I argue that their non-native accent functioned as a marker of their foreignness and became a basis for negative differential treatment in different spheres of life in the US. In the conclusion, I discuss the ways non-native accent can become a basis for discrimination in the context of the US and why migrants who experience discriminatory treatment do not call it discrimination.Stigma and Discrimination Based on Non-Native/ L2(2011) argues that, like any other group of scholars, linguists do not form a homogeneous club; there are several differences of opinion among them. However, there are also certain points about which all linguists agree. She identifies five linguistic facts of life, where, she argues, most linguists would come together (Lipi-Green 2011 6–7).All spoken language changes over time.All spoken languages are equal in terms of linguistic potential.Grammaticality and communicative effectiveness are distinct and independent issues.Written language and spoken language are historically, structurally and functionally fundamentally different creatures.Variation is intrinsic to all spoken language at every level, and much of that variation serves an emblematic purpose.By stating the last point, Lipi-Green (2011, 20) points out the fact that spoken language varies for every speaker. If the language in question is English, this is ‘true even for those who believe themselves to speak an educated, elevated, supra-regional English’ (Lipi-Green 2011, 20–21). There are three major sources of variation in spoken language: language internal pressures, external influences on language and variation arising from language as a creative vehicle on free expression (Lipi-Green 2011, 21). Considering the variation in spoken language, she talks about standard language and non-accent as myths, reminding readers that ‘myths are used to justify social order, and to encourage or coerce consensual participation in that order’ (Lipi-Green 2011, 44). Following this line of argument, it will be appropriate to approach the notion of non-accent as a myth that justifies existing hierarchies between the individuals who have the ‘right’ accent and those who do not.Goffman (1963, 12), in his classic work, defines stigma as ‘an attribute that is deeply discrediting’. However, after giving this definition, he also emphasizes that we need a language of relationships, not a language of attributes while we are talking about stigma. It means that there may be certain attributes that will be discrediting in one context, while confirming the usualness in another context. In that sense, it may be more appropriate to think of stigma as ‘a special kind of relationship between attribute and stereotype’ (Goffman 1963,13). He discusses three different types of stigma based on various physical deformities, character traits and race, nation and religion, commonly interpreted as group identity (Goffman 1963, 13). The person who has a stigma possesses an undesired differentness from what others expect, and those others who conform to expectations are ‘normals’, as Goffman (1963, 14) identifies them. These ‘normals’ then exercise various types of discrimination against those with stigma and reduce their life chances (Goffman 1963, 15).According to this framework, can non-native accent function as a basis for stigma?Being an indicator that one was born and raised in another country, non-native accent can be a basis for the third type of stigma that Goffman discusses. ‘Normals’ are the ones who speak the language with native accents, while those who have non-native accents are stigmatized. Although everybody has an accent and not having an accent is a myth, people use accent to make judgements about others, both in their official capacities and in everyday life encounters. In everyday usage, people say ‘a person has an accent’ to point out the difference from an assumed norm of non-accent, as if only foreigners have accent (Matsuda 1991). A non-native accent is one of the most noticeable characteristics of those individuals who are originally from other countries, and marks and potentially stigmatizes them as not being native born (Gluszek and Dovidio 2010).Research shows that native speakers/listeners are highly sensitive to the presence of foreign accents (Atagi and Bent 2017; Derwing and Munro 2009). Accent is certainly not the only factor that people use to evaluate others. There are many other categories, such as gender, skin color, other physical features, etc. However, as Derwing et al. (2014, 66) emphasize, society has become more aware of prejudices based on these categories and is more prepared to guard vulnerable groups against them compared to accent prejudices. Especially regarding the US context, researchers argue that following increasingly tighter anti-discrimination laws in the US, more subtle ways for exclusion have been created, and language and accent have become an acceptable excuse to discriminate (Gluszek and Dovidio 2010). As Zuidema (2005, 666) argues, linguistic prejudice is an ‘acceptable’ American prejudice; assumptions are made about the others’ intelligence, competence, morality, etc. based on how they speak. Teachers, employers and landlords assume that a person whose first language is English might be a better student, employee or tenant than another person who speaks English with a non-native accent. Accordingly, these assumptions do not remain inconsequential thoughts, but turn into activeLipi-Green (2011, 67) states,When an individual is asked to reject their own language, we are asking them to drop allegiances to the people and places that define them. We do not, cannot under our laws, ask a person to change the color of her skin, her religion, her gender, her sexual identity, but we regularly demand of people that they suppress or deny the most effective way they have of situating themselves socially in the world.In other words, native speakers very often demand too easily that foreigners shift from their own language to another one, ignoring the complex and deeply rooted meanings of native language for individuals. In addition to discussing the desirability of an immediate language and accent shift, we can also question how doable it is. Researchers often refer to a critical period for second language acquisition (Vanhove, 2013). According to the critical period hypothesis, there is a critical period for attainment of second language and, beyond the critical period, people cannot achieve native-like competence in their second language.[1] Researchers argue that there is enough evidence to support the argument that there is an age-based limitation on the attainment of proficiency in a second language (Patkowski 1990). Therefore, if we consider the widely accepted notion that learning a second language after early childhood almost inevitably leads to non-native accent and speech that is different from the speech of native speakers (Tahta et al. 1981; Scovel 1988; Flege et al. 1995; Munro et al. 2006), expecting people to drop their L2 accent is almost like expecting them to change the color of their skin. It is unrealistic to expect a person who learned English as an adult to speak like a native speaker of English (Ingram 2009). However, it is rarely recognized as such, and differential treatment based on L2 accent is not considered as discrimination by many. As Akomolafe (2013) argues, of the major types of discrimination, accent discrimination is the one that gets the least attention.Munro (2003) discusses the probable reasons behind negative reactions to foreign accents. The first possibility he discusses is accent stereotyping, where one’s prejudice against a certain group is triggered when that person hears speech patterns associated with that group. The second possibility is that some people find accented speech unintelligible or difficult to comprehend. While he evaluates this second argument, he stresses that there is, in fact, no reason to think that accented language is typically difficult to understand, since ‘an objection to accents on the grounds that they are unintelligible may sometimes have more to do with an unwillingness to accommodate differences in one’s interlocutors than with a genuine concern about comprehension’ (Munro 2003, 40). Munro (2003) looks at human rights cases that involve language-related issues in Canada and argues that, in most of those cases, the notion of accent was crucial. In his study, he identifies three types of accent discrimination: discrimination in hiring decisions, discrimination in employment and tenancy and harassment based on accented speech (Munro 2003).What forms can non-native accent discrimination take in the context of the US? In the US, a person’s intellectual ability is often evaluated based on his/her ability to speak ‘standard English’, and people who speak with foreign accents can be subject to negative evaluation and discrimination (Ingram 2009).Nguyen (1993), with reference to the US context, also argues that employers use claims of ‘unintelligible English’ to not hire accented but qualified applicants. She also reminds the fact that courts have recognized how discrimination against accent may function as the equivalent of discrimination against national origin, a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Nguyen 1993, 1327). Some studies focus on the effects of non-native accents on employment-related decisions in the US (Hosoda and Romero 2010; Deprez-Sims and Morris 2010), which demonstrate that accent can have an impact on evaluations of an applicant’s suitability for a job. What do we know about the extent of accent-focused discrimination in the US? Lippi-Green (1997, 153) mentions a statistical study of a stratified random sample of employers nationwide where 10 percent of the sample, or 461,000 companies, that employ millions of people openly disclosed that they ‘discriminated on the basis of a person’s foreign appearance or accent’. Although there is a need for further large-scale studies on the subject, this gives an idea about the extent of accent discrimination in theresearchers also argue that there is differential accent discrimination in the US (Holmes 1992; Quinn and Petrick 1993). This means that, in the evaluation of the accent, speaker’s non-native status is not the only applicable issue; perceptions about the speaker’s particular group or nationality can also be pertinent (Lindemann 2003). While the stigmatized identifier of using ‘broken’ English is used for non-native accents, this category may not necessarily apply to Western European accents (Lindemann 2005). Some non-native accents are considered high-status, whereas others are regarded as low-status. Low-status accents are usually thought of as difficult to comprehend and signaling incompetence, while high-status accents are evaluated as easy to understand and indicative of competence (Quinn and Petrick 1993; Matsuda 1991; Goto 2008). In the context of the US, a person with a high-status British accent will be regarded as well educated and upper class (Quinn and Petrick 1993) while French accents will be considered ‘cute’ (Lippi-Green 1997). In contrast, Hispanic, African and Eastern European accents will be considered negatively (Valles 2015). Individuals who speak English with a low-status foreign accent are more prone to accent discrimination (Akomolafe 2013; Valles 2015).Turkish Highly-Skilled Migrants in the USThis chapter highlights some findings of a broader research project about return migration of highly skilled Turkish migrants who lived in either the US or Germany, and then returned back to Turkey. In a previous paper (Yilmaz2019), I discussed the findings of this research project with respect to discrimination perceptions of these two groups of returnees. According to these findings, returnees from Germany thought they experienced ethnic discrimination, and discrimination was a major reason behind their return, while returnees from the US did not mention discrimination, and discrimination was not a reason for return for them. To explain the difference between these two contexts, I used Alba’s (2005) distinction between bright and blurry boundaries. I described Germany as a context that has bright ethnic boundaries for Turkish migrants even when we focus on a highly skilled group, whereas the US had blurry ethnic boundaries for this group. Many of the highly skilled Turkish migrants who lived in the US argued that they faced difficulties because of the fact that they speak English with a foreign accent. However, they did not consider those difficulties as discrimination.In this chapter, I focus on interviews with the respondents who lived in the US and, contrary to what they claimed, I argue that what they experienced can in fact be considered accent discrimination. By analyzing their responses to questions not only about language and accent, but also about their experiences in the US, I aim to demonstrate how and why the instances that they described as the challenges of being a foreigner can be thought of as examples of accent discrimination. In parallel with the previous discussion of the literature on accent discrimination, I argue that the reason they do not think of these negative experiences as discrimination has to do with the fact that negative differential treatment based on foreign accent is rarely recognized as discrimination. Although they shared their negative experiences related to foreign accent as events that made their life more difficult and made them unhappy, they either blamed themselves individually for those experiences, as they were ‘unsuccessful’ in dropping their accent, or they thought of it as a part of the ‘inevitable burden’ attached to being a foreigner.As mentioned previously, this research concerns highly skilled migrants. We interviewed people who emigrated from Turkey with at least an undergraduate degree (in three cases as university exchange students), had further degrees and/or professional experience in the host country and stayed there for at least five years and then returned back to Turkey. We conducted the interviews in Turkey after their return. Most of the interviews were conducted face-to-face, although in a few cases, they were conducted on Skype. They were semi-structured, in-depth interviews in Turkish, which lasted 1.5 hours on average. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and translated into English by the author. We interviewed 40 returnees from the US. (We also interviewed 40 returnees from Germany. However, this chapter only focuses on the returnees from the US.) Our respondents were all over 20 years old at the time of their migration. The majority completed their secondary and high school education at institutions where the language of instruction was English, including private schools or competitive public schools, which accept students based on central, countrywide examinations. They also completed their university education at prestigious public or private universities, which instruct in English.in many cases, interviewees demonstrated their proficiency in written English, through their Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) or Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) scores, they had all learned English after early childhood or after the critical period, and most had few experiences speaking English in daily life before migrating. In general, they had few international experiences before migrating. Consequently, most interviewees expressed difficulties speaking English, especially during their first years in the US. Rather than the academic language with which they were familiar thanks to their education in Turkey, they found the language of everyday life more challenging during this initial period. Below are three responses about the challenge of using English in everyday life during the initial stage.My English was good. I received my education at Kadikoy Anadolu Lisesi[2] and Bogazici University[3]afterwards… I was pretty good at writing and reading, but I was not that good at speaking. During the first two years, I can say, I had some problems related to speaking. In terms of both expressing myself and also making myself understood by others… It was challenging for me because we were not practicing English in Turkey. Especially after the first three years, I started feeling more confident… I had never gone abroad before this experience.My business English was good. But to be more fluent in the language of everyday life, you need to know those simple words… Like tweezers… It was a word that I had never used in English previously. After living there, you learn the name for it when you need to buy tweezers. Do you know when I realized that I became fluent in English? The TV was on in the living room and I was cooking in the kitchen. But I could follow the conversations on TV easily, as if they were in Turkish. Before going to the US, the level of my English was in fact advanced. I had an internet-based TOEFL score of 113 out of 120. But, you know, as is common for many Turks, I did not find myself so good when it came to speaking. There were times when I had issues in everyday conversations, especially during the first years. Sometimes because of the idioms that they use, other times because of the accent… But except that, for instance in writing, I did not have problems.According to the accounts of our interviewees, although it created problems during the first period of their stay, the challenge of becoming familiar with everyday language and becoming fluent in using it was something that they could overcome. It was a problem that they could work on and solve. There was a need to gain more information about the cultural context, but for a person who was open to learning, it was possible to eventually get familiar with new ways of doing things. However, as some of them discussed during the interviews, ‘the problem of accent’ was not something that they could solve. After a while, they realized that how they were perceived when they spoke with a non-native accent was important in terms of positioning them, but they had little control over their accent even if they wanted to change it.When I first went to the US, there were some very simple idioms or sayings that I did not know. However, I think that was a problem only at the very beginning. In a pretty short period, it is possible to overcome the challenges related to understanding what others are saying. Another dimension is about the pace of your speech. That can also be solved relatively fast. If you have a tendency to speak a lot, or if you are brave enough, you can also solve that quickly. But you cannot solve the problem of accent. You cannot change it. That is, in fact, what it means to be American or to speak like an American… If you speak with the same accent, with the same pace as an American, then you can be accepted… The critical distinction was not about being Turkish or being something else, but it was mostly about whether or not you can have those conversations with the same accent, with the same pace. That is what we cannot do.This person feels that as a foreigner, he can only feel accepted in the US if he can speak English without a foreign accent. However, he also came to the realization that one cannot change his/her accent easily. In this context, while changing one’s accent or solving the ‘problem of accent’ becomes the condition of being accepted, it is also unachievable. Defined as such, it is easy to see how it can be the source of a lot of frustration. In another example, many years after her return, one interviewee still blamed herself for not having been able to drop her accent. She was still reflecting on what she could have done to ‘solve that problem’.I had many problems related to my accent, yes… As I had an accent, there was the problem of incomprehensibility. I wish I could have taken some courses… Courses on accent reduction for instance… Maybe it would have been useful for being understood.The accent came to be understood as the main sign of foreignness. According to these respondents, their foreignness was not necessarily something that others could immediately recognize based on their physical appearance. It became identifiable when they started speaking:The level of my English was advanced when I went to the US. I knew the language pretty well, I think… In Turkey, I’d had all my classes in English up to the completion of my Master’s degree. [In the US,] I did not find the academic life challenging. However, when it came to the language of everyday life… Even to have a conversation at a restaurant… You need to get used to it. And the biggest challenge about speaking was the accent. When they look at you from the outside, they don’t necessarily understand that you are a foreigner. However, at the moment you open your mouth and say something… You are a foreigner; you have an accent. I didn’t like the fact that I could never be ordinary. It is not like racism or hostility to foreigners but… They lump you in another category. In that sense, after that point, you can never be ordinary. It’s like, in terms of appearance, you are one of them. But when you start speaking, it becomes obvious that you are not one of them.This quotation is important in many ways. First, it tells us how this respondent perceives the distinctions between ‘us’ and ‘them’ in the context of the US. He thinks that his physical appearance does not necessarily mark him as different from the members of mainstream society. According to his understanding, for American people, the distinction is especially based on whether or not one speaks English with a foreign accent. If we rephrase this using Goffman’s (1963) vocabulary, non-native accent was the aspect that stigmatized them. Accent was what made it impossible for them to be ‘normal’. Once native speakers hear the accent, the person was identified as the Other, which from then on made it impossible to be an ‘ordinary person’; one is put into that other category of ‘the foreigner’.Respondents who lived in smaller towns or cities, which were less cosmopolitan, talked about having experienced even bigger problems in social life because of speaking English with a foreign accent. As the locals had limited experience interacting with people from other countries, their foreign accent became a significant barrier in everyday communication. However, according to the perception of our respondents, this barrier was not necessarily related to comprehension. Many of them talked about how they could successfully communicate with other international people in English during their stay in the US. They all spoke English as a second (or third or fourth) language, and they all had their different, peculiar accents. However, using English as a medium, they were able to communicate with each other effectively. According to some of our respondents, the problem about communicating with Americans in English was related to the fact that Americans ‘did not want to understand’ people who spoke English with non-native accents. This is in parallel with Munro’s (2003) argument about the intelligibility and comprehensibility of accented speech, which I discussed in the previous sections: The objection to accented speech on the grounds that ‘it is unintelligible seems to have more to do with an unwillingness to accommodate differences’. It seems to have less to do with a genuine concern aboutwas a problem. With international friends, it was not an issue. But with Americans, it was a totally different story… This is the thing about Americans: they see it as their right not to understand you if you are speaking with an accent. They claim that they don’t understand you. This really annoyed me both at the university and also outside. At the university, we were teaching, we were interacting with students. At the end of each semester, I got the same comment on evaluations: ‘He has a very strong accent. We don’t understand people who have accents, why do we have them as instructors’ and such… Always the same kinds of comments… Economics is not like, for instance, philosophy. I don’t need to lecture for hours. I solve problems, and then I explain the solutions with simple terminology. If you catch the terms, you will easily understand. But still, we always used to get the same types of comments.He believes that in the case of the students who complained about his accent, there was not a sincere interest in communicating or a sincere effort to understand what he was explaining. How the students phrased their comments on the evaluation forms, putting it as ‘he has a strong accent’ also provides a hint that the students saw it as their right to criticize accented English. They mentioned a fact almost as a defect. This respondent was not the only one who got the comment that ‘he has an accent’ on student evaluation forms. As mentioned earlier, many of our respondents went to the US for graduate degrees and worked as teaching assistants, instructors or professors during their studies and afterwards. Depending on their accounts, getting the comment that one has an accent as a criticism from students seems to be a common experience.Discussion and ConclusionIn this paper, I focused on non-native accent discrimination in the US, a type of discrimination that is not usually considered discrimination by the public and that has been a rather neglected subject in the sociological literature. Benefiting from the works of especially linguists, I argued that the notion of not having an accent is a myth, and for those people who learn a second language after the critical period, it is almost impossible not to have an L2 accent and to speak that language in the same way as a native speaker. Next, depending on Goffman’s (1963) arguments on stigma, I discussed how non-native accent can function as a basis for stigma. Moreover, depending on the literature, I also discussed how non-native accent can be a basis for discrimination, especially in the context of the US. Next, depending on our empirical research with highly skilled Turkish return migrants from the US, I tried to demonstrate what kind of difficulties or problems they had in the US related to speaking English as a second language and speaking it with an L2-accent. Our respondents had certified proficiency in English before their migration. However, having learned English during later years, not when they were kids, and not having spoken it in everyday life before their migration to the US as adults, they did not have native-level fluency and had a non-native accent. Referring to their narratives, I discussed the ways their non-native accent functioned as a marker of their difference, and what kind of problems it created for them.One important question to ask at this point is whether the problems related to non-native accent narrated by our respondents can be considered examples of discrimination. As Altman (2011) discusses, although there are some disagreements about the definition of discrimination, it is possible to say that ‘discrimination consists of acts, practices or policies that impose a relative disadvantage on persons based on their membership in a salient social group.’ With its emphasis on salience, this definition suggests that groups based on, for instance, race, gender and religion can be potential grounds of discrimination, while groups based on, for instance, ‘length of toe nails’ would not count. Additionally, the definition of discriminatory conduct also indicates that it creates some kind of disadvantage or harm for those at whom it is directed. This disadvantage or harm is determined relative to a comparison group.According to this definition, I argue that the accent-related problems that our respondents mentioned during the interviews can be considered examples of discrimination, although most respondents did not think of them as discriminatory conduct. Their non-native accent positioned them in this salient social category of the foreigner (or maybe a foreigner with a low-status foreign accent) which put them in a disadvantaged position relative to those who speak with native accents or high-status foreign accents. As highly skilled migrants who left Turkey with at least undergraduate degrees, they were accepted to graduate programs or professional jobs based on both their subject-area competence and certified proficiency in English. However, even after getting used to speaking English in everyday life, they were treated differently relative to the comparison group of native speakers because of an aspect that they cannot in fact change, as the critical period argument suggests. This differential treatment led to disadvantages in their lives. Consequently, the experiences they mentioned count as discrimination based on non-native accent.How can we explain the fact that our respondents did not name these negative experiences as discrimination? First, like many other people, our respondents did not think that negative differential treatment based on accent would count as discrimination. They were thinking of discrimination as related to more well-known categories, such as race or gender. Additionally, when they noticed that they were assessed or treated negatively because of the kind of accent they had, they blamed themselves for ‘not having been able to’ drop their accent and speak ‘without accent’. Some of them eventually came to the realization that it is not achievable to speak in the same way as a native speaker if one migrates after a certain age. However, they had mixed feelings, and this realization seemed to exist together with self-blame. Furthermore, in general, it is very hard to be sure about or prove discrimination if it does not take the form of direct confrontation, and in many instances, it does not take that form. Therefore, in most other cases, people just ‘have a feeling’ that they are treated negatively. Based on such vague feelings, people hesitate to call those experiences discrimination.The fact that one is being discriminated against can position that person as a victim, and many people do not prefer to be seen as victims. Consequently, while responding to the questions of a researcher about whether they were discriminated against during their time in the US, they may not necessarily want to reconstruct their past as a painful one and name their experiences as discrimination. I also argue that being highly educated people who are used to perceiving themselves as having a high status, they do not want to situate themselves as having been in a disadvantaged position as migrants in the US, based on their own perception of situations.[4] While considering their negative experiences as ‘problems’ that happened once in a while is easier, naming them as ‘discrimination’ means attributing to them a more structural, permanent nature. Many of our respondents seemed to be unwilling to position themselves as having been exposed to such continuous negative treatment. Further studies that reflect on why migrants (as well as other groups of people) avoid naming differential treatment directed at them as discrimination can help us better understand the dynamics of this phenomenon."

Get your free download from E-International Relations.Latin American migrants constitute an important part of London. Yet they remain institutionally unrecognized. Despite the campaigns for visibility carried out by advocacy groups, such as the Coalition of Latin Americans in the United Kingdom (CLAUK), the British government has still not included the Latin American category in the British Ethnic Recognition Scheme used by institutions, such as the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to collect census data (CLAUK 2020). The absence of a demographic category means that the contributions of Latin Americans to British society and the everyday challenges they confront go unnoticed. Institutional invisibility has obscured the stories of how Latin American women nurture their families and communities. These stories have also remained untold by the limited scholarship on this community. Despite documenting the inequalities Latin Americans face in London, scholars have paid little attention to how these inequalities affect the families and communities of Latin American migrants and the role women play in coping with these inequalities.This chapter attempts to bring to light the experiences of London’s Latin American migrant women by presenting the practices through which they maintain and make their families, communities and rights visible. Specifically, this study focuses on the strategies London’s Latin American migrant women deploy to carry out social reproductive work, the ‘array of activities and relationships involved in maintaining people both on a daily basis and intergenerationally’ (Nakano Glenn 1992, 1). As such, social reproductive work refers to activities like domestic work, childcare and the intergenerational transmission of culture, but also the maintenance of community ties. This study is based on 203 hours of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between October 2018 and July 2019, which took place mostly within a London-based non-governmental organization (NGO) supporting Latin American migrants. During the fieldwork, the narratives of 17 Latin American women and 14 Latin American men were collected through semi-structured interviews. In this study, the category Latin American refers to people originally from South America, Central America and the Caribbean whose inhabitants speak Spanish, Portuguese or French (Kittleson et al. 2017). However, most of the people I met and interviewed during the fieldwork were middle-aged Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians working in low-income jobs.After problematizing the lack of attention on the social reproductive work of London’s Latin American migrant women, I present the literature conceptualizing social reproduction from a feminist perspective and the methodology used to conduct this study. I then describe the social reproduction work through which Latin American women ensure the survival of their families and communities. I will demonstrate how Latin American women’s social reproductive work acquires a political dimension, as it becomes key to the survival not only of their families but also of NGOs advocating for the rights and visibility of Latin American migrants in the UK. I conclude by calling for the recognition of the political nature of migrant women’s everyday social reproduction practices.Latin American Migrants inlived experiences of social reproduction among London’s Latin American migrant women have largely remained unaddressed. In what seems an effort to begin understanding the experiences of a relatively new and unrecognized migrant group in the UK, scholars have focused mostly on the reasons behind Latin Americans’ migration to the UK, their experiences in the labor market, in dealing with ‘illegality’ and in accessing support.Research shows that Latin American migration to the UK began increasing in the 1970s as an outcome of the socioeconomic instability in Latin America (McIlwaine et al. 2011). Latin American migration to the UK increased further with the tightening of immigration policies in the United States during the 1990s and after 9/11, which forced Latin Americans to look for alternative destinations to find job, safety and study opportunities (Pellegrino 2004). Following the 2008 global economic crisis, Latin Americans began migrating to the UK also from Southern Europe using the European passports acquired while living there (McIlwaine and Bunge 2016). Having been negatively affected by the crisis, Latin Americans living in Southern Europe decided to look for better opportunities in London (McIlwaine and Bunge 2016). In 2019, the ONS estimated that there were 255,000 people born in Central and South America in London.Much of the literature on the adaption experiences of London’s Latin Americans has focused on their experiences in the labor market. Research shows that a considerable size of London’s Latin American community earns salaries below the London Living Wage, the threshold for lifting people out of poverty in London (McIlwaine and Bunge 2016). Latin American migrants are overwhelmingly concentrated in low-paid jobs in the cleaning, care and construction sectors for which they are overqualified (McIlwaine and Bunge 2016; McIlwaine and Bunge 2018). Scholars attribute such downward mobility to limited English language skills and employers’ reluctance in recognizing their educational titles (McIlwaine and Bunge 2016).Other studies have addressed the experiences of London’s Latin Americans in dealing with ‘illegality’. McIlwaine et al. (2011) demonstrate the difficulties Latin Americans have had to enter and remain in the UK, since many were denied asylum and work permits. Dias’s (2017) study on the way Brazilians deal with being undocumented reveals how ‘illegality’ meant constantly moving between houses and odd jobs to avoid being identified. Gutierrez Garza (2018) introduced the expression ‘temporality of illegality’ to indicate how some Latin Americans in London would move in and out of ‘illegality’ due to changes in migration laws and expiring visas.Scholars have also highlighted the challenges facing London’s Latin American migrants to access social protection. In 2011, only one-fifth of London’s Latin American community received some kind of state assistance (McIlwaine and Bulge 2016). These numbers have been explained in terms of insufficient English language skills and lack of information available in Spanish and Portuguese (Turcatti and Assaraf 2020; Mas Giralt and Granada 2015). In this respect, scholars have shown the vital role played by the NGOs established and run by Latin Americans in supporting Latin American migrants to access health care and welfare benefits (Mas Giralt and Granada 2015; Turcatti and Assaraf 2019; Turcatti and Assaraf 2020).This scholarship has raised awareness about the inequalities facing Latin American migrants in London. However, researchers have paid relatively little attention to the practices through which London’s Latin American women maintain their families and communities. The literature we do have is sparse. Some studies have shown how social reproductive labor, such as domestic work, childcare and the transmission of heritage culture, is often carried out by women (Souza 2015; McIlwaine 2008; McIlwaine 2010). Other scholars have explored how Latin American migrant women care for their left-behind families from distance through remittances and by providing emotional support through visits and everyday communication (Passarelli Tonhati 2017).While demonstrating the key role Latin American women play in their families, these studies tend to confine women to the familial sphere, preventing us from fully appreciating how they contribute to their communities. In order to build on and expand this literature, this study presents the strategies Latin American migrant women living in London deploy to carry out social reproductive work not only to nurture families, but also to maintain their communities. The next section defines in more detail what social reproduction and social reproductive work is from a feministReproduction from a Feminist PerspectiveFrom a feminist perspective, social reproduction is a term that refers to ‘maintaining and sustaining human beings throughout their life cycle’ (Troung 1996, 32). As such, social reproductive work includes the activities needed to maintain and sustain human beings, which range from domestic work and the care of children, the elderly and the ill to the intergenerational transmission of culture (Kofman 2014). The maintenance of kin and communities has also been considered a form of social reproductive labor (Nakano Glenn 1992; Gedalof 2009).Since the seventies, feminists have highlighted the gendered nature of social reproductive work. Scholars such as Benston (1969) attributed the fact that it is often women who are held responsible for social reproductive work to gender ideologies constructing women as the ‘natural’ carers and men as the ‘natural’ breadwinners. Since the 1970s, feminists have placed reproductive labor at the center of women’s oppression due to its undervalued character and because reproductive responsibilities make climbing the social ladder harder for women (Benston 1969; Nakano Glennexposing the gendered nature of social reproductive labor, feminist scholars explain that the family is not the only site of social reproduction (Razavi 2013). Families can outsource reproductive tasks to other families (e.g., ask relatives or friends to care for their children) or use markets to arrange the provision of food (e.g., restaurants) or childcare (e.g., paid care workers) (Kofman 2014). The welfare state and NGOs also assume social reproductive functions. The welfare state provides households with benefits and health care, which may be vital for the social reproduction of low-income families, while NGOs can act as bridges to help families access welfare support (Razavi 2007). Put another way, the market, NGOs and the welfare state become resources that can be used to secure one’s family’s social reproduction.Yet access to such resources is uneven. Colen (1995, 78) coined the term ‘stratified social reproduction’ to indicate that social reproductive labor is ‘differentially experienced, valued and rewarded according to inequalities of access to material and social resources in particular historical and cultural contexts’. Colen (1995) developed this concept from her investigation of the parenting practices of West Indian childcarers and of their employers in New York. Colen found that the migration of West Indian middle-class mothers allowed their employers in New York to secure two salaries and their children’s care. This meant, however, that West Indian carers could not provide the same level of security to their children, as they would struggle with both bringing their children to the US and providing them with adequate childcare, due to fragmented local networks, low wages, low-quality housing and insecure legal status.Framed by this literature, this study investigates the kind of social reproductive work London’s Latin American women do to sustain their families and communities and the meaning such work acquires in a context of institutional invisibility. The next section describes the methodology used to understand the lived experiences of social reproduction of London’s Latin American women.Understanding Social Reproduction through EthnographyThe everyday social reproduction practices of Latin American women were documented through 203 hours of ethnographic fieldwork mostly conducted between October 2018 and May 2019 in a London-based NGO. Run by Latin Americans, this NGO helps Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking migrants access welfare support, health care and their employment rights through one-on-one advice sessions. The NGO also provides English classes, social events and workshops on topics that interest the NGO’s clients.The fieldwork started by collecting data through participant observation at the NGO. I participated in 68 advisor-client one-on-one sessions and in various social activities and workshops. Conducting participant observation at the NGO allowed me to become more familiar with the kind of everyday challenges Latin American migrants and their families face and for which they seek support, while also observing the role women play in the NGO.Apart from participant observation, I collected the narratives of 17 Latin American women and 14 Latin American men through semi-structured interviews aimed at understanding the ways in which Latin American migrants make sense of their lived experiences of social reproduction. I interviewed both men and women in order to better understand the role that women play in their families and communities by comparing what men and women said about their social reproductive labor. Most of the interviewees were accessed through the NGO and were Colombians, Ecuadorians and Peruvians, middle-aged, documented and working in low-paid jobs, mostly in the cleaning sector. The interviews lasted between 45 and 90 minutes, were recorded and were conducted intranscribing field notes and interviews, I assigned pseudonymous to participants and removed potential identifiers in order to protect anonymity and confidentiality. Field notes and interview transcripts were then analyzed through thematic analysis, defined by Braun and Clarke (2006, 79) as ‘a method for identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns (themes) within data’. This analytical method was chosen as this study aimed to identify ‘themes’, such as the types of family and community responsibilities participants may have.The findings are presented in the next two sections. First, I present the social reproductive practices through which Latin American women ensure the survival of their families. I then discuss Latin American women’s social reproductive labor in their communities and how these are fundamental to making their families, communities and rights visible.From Ensuring the Survival of their Families…Through a variety of everyday practices, Latin American women nurture and ensure the survival of their families in economic, social and cultural terms. First, the Latin American women I met while conducting participant observation at the NGO and whom I interviewed played important breadwinning roles in their families. They would often work along their partners to provide for their children, while single mothers were often the only breadwinners in their families. Women’s salaries, regardless of whether they had children or partners, were often meant to enhance the lives of family members living in other countries. If in some cases remittances were meant to raise their families’ living standards, they often secured everyday necessities.In order to provide for their families, women would often work long hours in more than one company. Working in the cleaning and domestic sector meant that their salary was often below the London Living Wage, the wage required to lift people out of poverty in London. While both women and men worked long hours, it was mostly women who would queue at the NGO waiting to be attended by one of the advisors to inquire about the welfare benefits to which their families were entitled and to seek help filling out the application forms for welfare benefits and social housing.Apart from playing a key role in securing their families’ everyday necessities, women were often responsible for domestic work, childcare and the care of the elderly living in the UK. Unable to afford nurseries or residential homes and in absence of family members living in London who could help them with childcare and the care of the elderly, parents reported sharing some of these tasks. Single mothers, on the other hand, had to be both ‘fathers and mothers’. As Annamaria, a Colombian single mother with three children put it:Sometimes I rest to find the strength to cook… clean… do laundry… talk with my daughter… feed my children… meet their teacher, check how they do at school… ask them how they are doing these days… make sure I have the money to buy them shoes to go to school.Yet it is important to highlight that having a partner does not necessarily mean help with domestic work and childcare, as Rosana, a Peruvian mother with a two-year-old son, repeatedly emphasized during the interview. Rosana explained how her ex-partner would not help her at nights when their baby was just born. Instead, he expected her to do his laundry, cook and keep their baby quiet so that he couldwomen would also care for family members living elsewhere. For instance, some of the Latin American women I met while conducting participant observation at the NGO and who I interviewed were or had been at some point in their life transnational mothers. For seven years, Hadi could not bring her two children, who remained in Venezuela with their grandmother, to the UK. Being a transnational mother meant sending remittances back home to ensure her children had access to food, a roof and education. Furthermore, through ‘chats all the time, video calls day and night’, Hadi would do her best to provide her children with the guidance and emotional support they need to deal with issues ranging from how to deal with discussions with friends to making sense of why she has been away so long.For some Latin American women I interviewed, securing the survival of their families meant helping them cross borders and settle in London.Daniela, a Colombian woman who came to London during the 1980s, explained how she helped her siblings escape the violence they experienced in Colombia:They [her siblings] didn’t suffer here. They stayed with me [at her house], they found jobs [she found work for them], they got their documents [she instructed them on how to get them]. Step by step, they organized themselves.According to Daniela, had she not shared her resources with her siblings, her family members would either be in danger or scattered around the world by now.Latin American women’s social reproductive work included organizing family gatherings in order to maintain the strength of familial bonds. It was women who would often organize visits to their left-behind families, when they could afford them and when their legal status allowed them to travel. Gathering the family also means getting together with loved ones who live in London. Romina, a Bolivian mother, provides an example:When my husband comes home from work… we have a family moment. We sit on the bed and play with our baby… But to have that moment, the baby needs to be cleaned and the food ready.The importance of creating the conditions that allow families to enjoy ‘family moments’, as Romina calls them, can be best appreciated when considering the fact that, for many of the people I interviewed and met at the NGO, free time is a luxury. Working long hours often limits the time available to families to be together.For many of the women I interviewed and met at the NGO, nurturing their families also meant maintaining their heritage languages. For instance, women wanted their children to be able to communicate with them and their family members. Women, more often than men, reported spending time teaching their children Spanish and planning activities that would foster the learning of Spanish. This was made evident during the interview with Xiomara, a Colombian woman I interviewed whose children are now in their twenties. Xiomara explained that, apart from talking to them in Spanish, she would take them to the free Spanish classes offered by an NGO in London and test their Spanish after class. She used to tell her children: ‘when you learn it well [Spanish], you will be able to speak the language you want [Spanish orfor the women I interviewed, nurturing their families also meant teaching their children about their heritage cultures. Mothers and parents would often mention during the interviews how they feared their children becoming ‘too British’ and not appreciating their heritage culture, which would lead to familial misunderstandings. This is why mothers would cook heritage food and take them to so-called Latin shops and Latin organizations to meet other Latin Americans and participate in their cultural activities.The women I interviewed tended to be proud of the efforts they make every day to nurture their families. Yet the fact that some of the women would burst out into tears during the interview is a testament to how ensuring the social reproduction of their families is not always easy when lacking support and socioeconomic resources. As Sofia, an Ecuadorian woman, put it: ‘you have to find the strength even if you don’t have it’. What motivates women to find such strength can be appreciated through the words a young Colombian woman used to console Annamaria, a single mother who was crying in the hall of the NGO where I conducted fieldwork:In a few years, your children will recognize your fights and they will keep you as a queen. They will have a diploma and will become someone.It is clear that what keeps many women going is the hope that their efforts will bring a better future to their families.…to Making their Families, Communities and Rights VisibleLatin American women are key not only to the social reproduction of their families, but also of their communities. Some volunteer for their communities where Latin American migrants receive help and support. Other women contribute to the maintenance of a shared ‘Latin American’ identity on the basis of which Latin American migrants created and keep developing NGOs advocating for the rights and institutional recognition of London’s Latin American migrants. There are also women who become leaders in their own communities in order to enhance the quality of life of London’s Latin American migrants and claim for their recognition and visibility.At the NGO where I conducted participant observation, the majority of volunteers were Latin American women who would help at the organization by answering calls at the reception, helping to clean the office or cooking lunch for the advisors. Some women would also help advisors address the NGO clients’ questions when they had the skills and the time to do so. For example, having studied law in Spain and being more fluent in English, Fernanda, a Colombian woman who came to the UK from Spain, decided to volunteer at the NGO and help advisors with minor tasks, such as helping clients figure out whether their driving license is valid in the UK and what to do if it is not. These women’s volunteer work should not be underestimated. As one of the community workers explained, there are not funds specifically allocated for the Latin American community, precisely because Latin Americans are still not institutionally recognized. This means that the NGO is severely understaffed and overworked. To attend the clients that queue at the NGO every day, advisors had little time to have lunch and take breaks. This is why the volunteer work of Latin American women in the NGO isAmerican women are also key to the maintenance of a shared ‘Latin American’ identity on the basis of which Latin American migrants create and keep developing NGOs advocating for the rights and institutional recognition of London’s Latin American migrants. At the NGO where I conducted fieldwork, women were often responsible for organizing activities and social events such as monthly gatherings and parties. In these events, women would often cook heritage food. For major events, such as the Christmas party and the anniversary party of the NGO, they would invite professional dancers to perform choreographies based on salsa, cumbia and bachata music. By doing so, Latin American women create spaces where their heritage cultures can be celebrated and enacted. As one of the advisors of the NGO emphasized, these social and cultural activities play an important function in making Latin Americans feel they belong to the same community despite their diverse cultural backgrounds, histories and migratory trajectories. The sense of belonging to a Latin American community instils an obligation to help each other, which is the rationale and the motor of many of the NGOs in London funded by Latin Americans, including the one where I conducted fieldwork, whose objective is to enhance the quality of life and claim the recognition of Latin American migrants in the UK.Here it is important to emphasize that the Latin American women I interviewed contribute to the social reproduction of their communities even when not directly volunteering in their communities. In the previous section, I highlighted the social reproductive work women do to maintain and reproduce their heritage cultures and languages inter-generationally. These practices contribute to their children’s development and the maintenance of a Latin American identity. Feeling Latin American, the second generations may decide to contribute to enhance the quality of life of other Latin Americans living in London once they grow up. At the NGO where I conducted fieldwork, one of the advisors was a young woman in her twenties who was the daughter of a Colombian woman who came to the UK as an asylum seeker. Claudia studied at university and decided first to volunteer and then work for the NGO where I conducted fieldwork as she wanted to use the knowledge and skills that she acquired in school to support London’s Latin American migrants. The case of Claudia is only one example of how Latin American women play a crucial role in the social reproduction of their communities even when not directly involved in volunteer or community work merely by virtue of transmitting their heritage culture to their children.Finally, I met and interviewed women who had become leaders in their own communities and contribute more proactively to enhance the quality of life of London’s Latin American migrants. The case of Valeria, a Colombian mother, illustrates this. Valeria approached the NGO where I conducted fieldwork a few years ago when she was diagnosed with a chronic illness that prevented her from working and supporting her two children. At the NGO, the advisors helped her access health care and the welfare benefits she needed until she could return to work. Since then, Valeria started participating in various activities of the NGO and volunteering, as it was a space for her to not feel alone. When her health got better, Valeria decided to start a course to become an advisor specialized in social housing and began volunteering for the NGO by assisting advisors helping migrants access social housing. While she was still training at the time of my research, she started to handle some social housing cases at the NGO on her own. She also became the president of the board of trustee of the NGO, where key decisions about the kind of services that the NGO provides to the Latin American community are made.There are many reasons why women participated in their communities more or less actively. Some of the women I met volunteered at the NGO where I conducted fieldwork because they wanted to ‘give back’. Having been helped by the NGO to access health care and the welfare benefits to which they are entitled; volunteering was a way of expressing their gratitude to the advisors of the organization. At the same time, volunteering was a way of socializing and making friends with people who understood them by virtue of coming from the same culture, speaking the same language or having shared similar challenges. There were also women who more explicitly stated that their community involvement stemmed from being aware of the lack of support available to Latin American migrants in London. ‘We are invisible’, Valeria said, ‘and I want to support my community, the same way they supported me’. Yet, regardless of the reasons why and the extent to which women become involved in their communities, Latin American women play a crucial role for the social reproduction and therefore survival of these communities.ConclusionIn order to bring to light the experiences of London’s Latin American migrant women, this chapter presented the practices through which London’s Latin American women maintain and make their families, communities and rights visible. Specifically, this study focused on the strategies London’s Latin American migrant women deploy to carry out social reproductive work for their families and their communities and the function that such work acquires in a context of invisibility.This chapter showed that Latin American women play a crucial role in the social reproduction of their families. While at times men and women shared domestic and childcare tasks, women were often responsible for these. Women were also breadwinners in addition to being responsible for keeping families together by organizing family gatherings, helping their family members migrate to London and transmitting their heritage cultures to the next generation.Apart from securing the survival of their families in economic, social and cultural terms, there were women who would volunteer for NGOs and communities supporting Latin American migrants in London. Fieldwork allowed me to appreciate the journey some women undertake to become leaders in their own communities, where the objective is to enhance the quality of life of London’s Latin American migrants and claim for their recognition and visibility.In a context of institutional invisibility, the social reproductive work Latin American women do to nurture their families and communities acquires a political dimension. By volunteering and becoming leaders in their communities, women ensure that the NGOs enhancing the quality of life and visibility of Latin American migrants in London continue to operate. By passing along their cultures to the next generations, women are keeping up the hope that these Latin American communities and organizations will be supported by the next generations and continue to claim for the rights and visibility of London’s Latin American migrants.Not only does this chapter make visible the experiences of London’s Latin American migrant women, it also clearly demonstrates how confining migrant women’s social reproductive work to the private realm of domesticity prevents us from appreciating its political and public dimensions. Only when considering the social reproductive work migrant women do both within their families and for their communities can we appreciate and recognize the political nature of migrant women’s everyday social reproduction practices within and beyond the boundaries of domesticity."
